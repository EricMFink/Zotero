    Politics by Other Means explores the fundamental question of how law can
    constrain political power by offering a pathbreaking account of the
    triumphant final decade of the struggle against apartheid.  Richard Abel
    presents case studies of ten major legal campaigns including: challenges to
    pass laws; black trade union demands for recognition; state terror;
    censorship; resistance to the "independent" homelands; and treason trials.

    The US 'war on terror', which Bush declared and Obama continued, repeatedly
    violated fundamental rule of law values. Law's Wars: The Fate of the Rule of
    Law in the US 'War on Terror' is the first comprehensive account of efforts
    to resist and correct those violations. It focuses on responses to abuses in
    Abu Ghraib, efforts by Guantánamo Bay detainees to improve conditions of
    confinement in and win release, exposés of and efforts to end torture and
    electronic surveillance, and civilian casualties on the battlefield,
    including targeted killings. Abel deploys a law and society perspective to
    construct and analyze detailed narratives of the roles of victims,
    whistle-blowers, the media, NGOs, lawyers, doctors, politicians, military
    personnel, foreign governments and international organizations in defending
    the rule of law. Only by understanding past errors can we hope to prevent
    their repetition in what promises to be an endless 'war on terror'.

  abstract: >-
    The US 'war on terror' has repeatedly violated fundamental rule of law
    values. When executive and legislature commit such egregious wrongs, courts
    represent the ultimate defense. Law's Trials: The Performance of Legal
    Institutions in the US 'War on Terror' offers the first comprehensive
    account of judicial performance during the 16 years of the Bush and Obama
    administrations. Abel examines criminal prosecutions of alleged terrorists,
    courts martial of military personnel accused of law of war violations,
    military commission trials of 'high value detainees', habeas corpus
    petitions by Guantánamo detainees, civil damage actions by victims of both
    the 'war on terror' and terrorism, and civil liberties violations by
    government officials and Islamophobic campaigners. Law's Trials identifies
    successful defenses of the rule of law through qualitative and quantitative
    analyses, comparing the behavior of judges within and between each category
    of cases and locating those actions in a comparative history of efforts to
    redress fundamental injustices.

  abstract: >-
    This detailed portrait of American lawyers traces their efforts to
    professionalize during the last 100 years by erecting barriers to control
    the quality and quantity of entrants. Abel describes the rise and fall of
    restrictive practices that dampened competition among lawyers and with
    outsiders. He shows how lawyers simultaneously sought to increase access to
    justice while stimulating demand for services, and their efforts to regulate
    themselves while forestalling external control. Data on income and status
    illuminate the success of these efforts. Charting the dramatic
    transformation of the profession over the last two decades, Abel documents
    the growing number and importance of lawyers employed outside private
    practice (in business and government, as judges and teachers) and the
    displacement of corporate clients they serve. Noting the complexity of
    matching ever more diverse entrants with more stratified roles, he depicts
    the mechanism that law schools and employers have created to allocate
    graduates to jobs and socialize them within their new environments. Abel
    concludes with critical reflections on possible and desirable futures for
    the legal profession.

  abstract: >-
    Toward the end of the twentieth century, English lawyers enjoyed widespread
    respect and prosperity. They had survived criticism by practitioners and
    academics and a Royal Commission enquiry, but the final decade witnessed
    profound changes. First the Conservatives sought to apply
    laissez-faireprinciples to the profession. Then Labour transformed the legal
    aid scheme it had created half a century earlier. At the same time, the
    profession confronted cumulative changes in higher education and women's
    aspirations, internal and external competition, and dramatic fluctuations in
    demand. Thisbook analyses the politics of professionalism during that
    tumultuous decade, the struggles among individual producers (barristers,
    solicitors, foreign lawyers, accountants) their associations, consumers
    (individual and corporate, public and private) and the state to shape the
    market for legalservices by deploying economic, political and rhetorical
    resources (including changing conceptions of professionalism).The profession
    had to respond to a greatly increased production of law graduates and the
    desire of lawyer mothers (and also fathers) to raise their families. It had
    to replace exclusivity with efforts to reflect the larger society (class,
    race, gender). The Bar needed to address challenges to itsexclusive rights
    of audience from both solicitors and employed barristers and decide whether
    to retaliate by permitting direct access, thereby compromising its claim to
    be a consulting profession. Solicitors had to reconcile their invocation of
    market principles against the Bar with their resistanceto corporate
    conveyancing and multidisciplinary practices. Government had to restrain a
    demand-led legal aid scheme; practitioners and their associations sought to
    pressure the government to expand eligibility and raise remuneration
    rates.Divisions within both branches so compromised self-regulation and
    governance that the government even threatened to deprive lawyers of those
    essential elements of professionalism.These challenges have begun a
    transformation of the legal profession that will shape its evolution
    throughout the twenty-first century.

    This book seeks to provide answers to everything you ever wanted to know
    about the law—except what the rules are or ought to be. For centuries, the
    law has been considered a neutral, objective arena that sets societal
    standards and in which conflicting forces resolve disputes. More recently,
    however, the interaction between law and society has been recognized as a
    two-way street: society clearly exacts a considerable influence on the
    practice and evolution of law. Further, the discrepancy between what the law
    mandates and what the social reality is has served as evidence of the chasm
    between theory and practice, between the abstraction of law and its actual
    societal effects. Examining such issues as the limits of legal change and
    the capacity of law to act as a revolutionary agent, the essays in this book
    offer a well-rounded introduction to the relationship between law and
    society. By focusing on flashpoint issues in legal studies—equality,
    consciousness and ideology, social control--and making ample use of engaging
    case studies, The Law and Society Review provides an invaluable resource for
    scholars and students alike.

    Among all those who encounter the law in the conduct of their lives or who
    consider it as a career, few have a solid understanding of the legal
    profession in America, and fewer still know anything about systems in other
    parts of the world. Lawyers in Society offers a concise comparative
    introduction to the practice of law in a number of countries: England,
    Germany, Japan, Venezuela, and Belgium.  Extracted from the editors&#39;
    three highly successful volumes Lawyers in Society, these essays guide
    readers through the differing worlds of civil and common law, law in Europe
    and Asia, and first and third world legal systems. One contribution
    addresses the changing role of women in the profession--women comprise half
    of all new lawyers in most countries--and the changes they are bringing. A
    new introduction and concluding essay reflect on the place of this volume in
    current and future research.

  abstract: >-
    Lawyer misconduct affects many people: clients, adversaries, opposing
    counsel, judges, the legal profession, and society at large. The records of
    disciplinary proceedings offer a penetrating, and largely ignored,
    perspective on how lawyers misbehave. Because the lawyers' professional
    lives are at stake, the factual records are extraordinarily detailed and the
    lawyers surprisingly open about their motivations and justifications. In
    Lawyers on Trial, Richard L. Abel presents the stories of ten California
    lawyers who broke the rules: hiring an ex-cop to chase ambulances, flouting
    fee limitations in medical malpractice cases, creating a fictitious company
    and impersonating non-existent people in order to appropriate Sega's
    computer games, a former California Real Estate Commissioner defrauding
    developers and financiers, helping a represented co-defendant negotiate a
    plea without his lawyer's participation or knowledge, and defying a judge's
    sealing order and his own client's wishes for closure in order to champion
    the "defenseless" and "oppressed" and protect "widows and children." The
    book begins by showing how nearly a century of political struggle over
    self-regulation shapes the way the disciplinary system selects and processes
    cases and concludes by canvassing reforms that could improve the performance
    of the legal profession. Lawyers on Trial will be invaluable for those
    contemplating law school, law students and teachers of professional
    responsibility, continuing legal education classes, lawyers encountering
    ethical dilemmas in their practice or trying to understand misbehaving
    colleagues, members of the public thinking of retaining a lawyer, and
    clients dealing with their own lawyers.

    The legal origin hypothesis claims that diversity across national systems of
    production can be explained by the influence of common law and civil law
    modes of regulation on economic development. If this hypothesis were
    correct, “liberal market” systems such as the United States and Britain
    would owe their liquid capital markets and shareholder-oriented corporate
    governance, in part at least, to their common law heritage; in the
    “coordinated market” systems of mainland Europe or East Asia, by contrast,
    multistakeholder forms of governance would be underpinned by civil law
    practices and precepts. Thanks to the transplantation of Western legal

  abstract: >-
    In Nobody’s Law (2018), Marc Hertogh introduced the notion of legal
    alienation as part of a ‘secular’ approach to legal consciousness, i.e. one
    that does not assume law’s hegemonic power in everyday life. This approach
    has been criticised, with it being suggested that it does not refute claims
    about law’s hegemonic power but partly explains resistance to it. I argue
    here that critical discussion of legal alienation is hampered by the
    employment of different definitions of the ‘legal’ in legal consciousness
    studies: from legality as an ongoing social structure to positive/State law.
    Using the example of administrative justice studies, I demonstrate that this
    definitional divergence results in confusion about the role of law as a
    variable in legal consciousness research designs. Is the law what is to be
    explained, or does the law explain another outcome? In the interest of
    achieving meaningful and clear analytical constructions of the ‘legal’ in
    this context, I argue that legal consciousness and legal alienation are
    concepts that shall be conceived as embodying two different conceptions:
    ‘identification/non-identification’ and ‘relevance/irrelevance to
    behaviours, processes or outcomes’. Acknowledging this conceptual
    distinction is integral to bridging the theoretical and methodological
    divide between social-scientific and legal approaches to legal consciousness
    research.

    Most of the work of public interest law organizations does not make money.
    How do these organizations survive, given the economic realities of law
    practice? Drawing on survey data from a national random sample of public
    interest law firms, we investigate how funding models vary across public
    interest organizations and how funding sources affect these organizations'
    activities. We find funding structures have, over time, shifted away from
    foundation support toward government grants. Compared to other
    organizations, however, conservative organizations draw significantly less
    of their budget from federal and state grants, and significantly more of
    their budget from private contributions. Conservative organizations are
    significantly less likely than other organizations to rely on funding that
    prohibits engaging in class actions, receiving attorney's fees, or lobbying.
    Respondents reported that funding restrictions hamper their ability to
    negotiate favorable settlements, bring about systemic change, and represent
    vulnerable client communities. We close with a comparative institutional
    analysis of different funding models.

    Colleges and universities are legally required to attempt to prevent and
    redress sexual violations on campus. Neo-institutional theory suggests that
    the implementation of law by compliance professionals rarely achieves law?s
    goals. It is critical in claims-based systems that those who are potential
    claimants understand the law. This article demonstrates that (a) intended
    subjects of the law (colleges and universities) interpret and frame the law
    in very similar ways; (b) resultant policies are complex and difficult to
    navigate; and (c) university undergraduates in an experimental setting are
    not able to comprehend the Title IX policies designed to protect them. These
    findings suggest that current implementations of Title IX policies leave
    them structurally ineffective to combat sexual assaults on campus.

  abstract: >-
    Existing theories of the nature of the state in Western capitalist
    democracies have been mostly propounded from one of three major theoretical
    perspectives, each emphasising a particular aspect of the state: the
    'pluralist', which emphasises its democratic aspect: the 'managerial', which
    emphasises its bureaucratic elements: and the 'class', which focuses on its
    capitalistic aspect. Each of these theoretical perspectives has contributed
    something to our understanding of the state, but each also has its
    limitations. In this book, Alford and Friedland evaluate the strengths and
    weaknesses of each perspective and present a new, synthetic framework for a
    more comprehensive theory of the state. Impartially reviewing the major
    historical and empirical works within each theoretical tradition, they
    reveal how empirical study has been shaped by theoretical assumptions. They
    agree that each perspective has a distinctive 'power' to understand part of
    the reality of the modern state, although it is powerless to explain other
    parts. In each case, the part that can be explained is the perspective's
    'home domain', or the aspect of the state that it emphasises, while other
    aspects are either rejected or reinterpreted. The authors argue that the
    state cannot be adequately understood unless full account is taken of each
    of these home domains, and they suggest how the contributions of each
    perspective to the explanation of its own domain can be integrated into a
    new, and more powerful, theory.

    "The political nature of Absolutism has long been a subject of controversy
    within historical materialism. Developing considerations advanced in
    Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism, this book situates the Absolutist
    states of the early modern epoch against the prior background of European
    feudalism. It is divided into two parts. The first discusses the overall
    structures of Absolutism as a state-system in Western Europe, from the
    Renaissance onwards; and the difficult question of the relations between
    monarchy and nobility institutionalised by it, for which it suggests a
    general periodization. It then looks in turn at the trajectory of each of
    the specific Absolutist states in the dominant countries of the West -
    Spain, France, England and Sweden, set off against the case of Italy, where
    no major indigenous Absolutism developed. The second part of the work
    sketches a comparative prospect of Absolutism in Eastern Europe. It begins
    with an enquiry into the reasons why the divergent social conditions in
    themore backward half of the continent should have produced political forms
    apparently similar to those of the more advanced West. The peculiarities, as
    well as affinities, of Eastern Absolutism as a distinct type of royal state,
    are examined. The variegated monarchies of Prussia, Austria and Russia are
    surveyed, and the lessons asked of the counter-example of Poland. Finally,
    the structure of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans is taken as an external
    gauge by which the singularity of Absolutism as a European phenomenon is
    assessed. The work ends with some observations on the special position
    occupied by European development within universal history, which draws
    themes from both Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism and Lineages of the
    Absolutist State together into a single argument -- within their common
    limits -- as materials for debate. Two postscript notes treat, respectively,
    the notion of the 'Asiatic mode of production,' with particular reference to
    Islamic and Chinese history, and the experience of Japanese feudalism, as
    relevant controls for a study of the evolution of Europe up to the advent of
    industrial capitalism." -- from http://www.amazon.com (April 18, 2011).

    The definitive, bestselling book on the origins of nationalism, and the
    processes that have shaped it.Imagined Communities, Benedict Anderson’s
    brilliant book on nationalism, forged a new field of study when it first
    appeared in 1983. Since then it has sold over a quarter of a million copies
    and is widely considered the most important book on the subject. In this
    greatly anticipated revised edition, Anderson updates and elaborates on the
    core question: what makes people live and die for nations, as well as hate
    and kill in their name? Anderson examines the creation and global spread of
    the ‘imagined communities’ of nationality, and explores the processes that
    created these communities: the territorialization of religious faiths, the
    decline of antique kinship, the interaction between capitalism and print,
    the development of secular languages-of-state, and changing conceptions of
    time and space. He shows how an originary nationalism born in the Americas
    was adopted by popular movements in Europe, by imperialist powers, and by
    the movements of anti-imperialist resistance in Asia and Africa.In a new
    afterword, Anderson examines the extraordinary influence of Imagined
    Communities, and the book's international publication and reception, from
    the end of the Cold War era to the present day.

    State bar licensing authorities and law schools have been debating whether
    the passing score on the bar exam is set at the right level or should be
    lowered. Much of the debate centers on generalizations without evidence
    about the effect that changes to the bar exam may have.We present data
    suggesting that lowering the bar examination passing score will likely
    increase the amount of malpractice, misconduct, and discipline among
    lawyers. Using a large dataset drawn from publicly available California
    State Bar records, our analysis shows that bar exam score is significantly
    related to likelihood of State Bar discipline throughout a lawyer’s career.
    We investigate these claims by collecting data on disciplinary actions and
    disbar-ments among California-licensed attorneys. We find support for the
    assertion that attorneys with lower bar examination performance are more
    likely to be disciplined and disbarred than those with higher
    performance.Although our measures of bar performance have only modest
    predictive power of subsequent discipline, we project that lowering the
    passing score would result in the admission of attorneys with a
    substantially higher probabil-ity of bar discipline over the course of their
    careers. But we admit that our anal-ysis is limited due to the imperfect
    data available to the public. And we do not infer a causal relationship
    between low bar scores and high discipline rates. For a precise calculation,
    we call on state licensing authorities to use their in-ternal records on bar
    scores and discipline outcomes to determine the likely impact of changes to
    the passing score.

    A Wall Street Journal Business Bestseller  In this "lively and entertaining"
    (Liaquat Ahamed, The New Yorker) history of ideas, New York Times editorial
    writer Binyamin Appelbaum tells the story of the people who sparked four
    decades of economic revolution.Before the 1960s, American politicians had
    never paid much attention to economists. But as the post-World War II boom
    began to sputter, economists gained influence and power.In The Economists'
    Hour, Binyamin Appelbaum traces the rise of the economists, first in the
    United States and then around the globe, as their ideas reshaped the modern
    world, curbing government, unleashing corporations and hastening
    globalization.Some leading figures are relatively well-known, such as Milton
    Friedman, the elfin libertarian who had a greater influence on American life
    than any other economist of his generation, and Arthur Laffer, who sketched
    a curve on a cocktail napkin that helped to make tax cuts a staple of
    conservative economic policy.Others stayed out of the limelight, but left a
    lasting impact on modern life: Walter Oi, a blind economist who dictated to
    his wife and assistants some of the calculations that persuaded President
    Nixon to end military conscription; Alfred Kahn, who deregulated air travel
    and rejoiced in the crowded cabins on commercial flights as the proof of his
    success; and Thomas Schelling, who put a dollar value on human life.Their
    fundamental belief? That government should stop trying to manage the
    economy.Their guiding principle? That markets would deliver steady growth,
    and ensure that all Americans shared in the benefits. But the Economists'
    Hour failed to deliver on its promise of broad prosperity. And the
    single-minded embrace of markets has come at the expense of economic
    equality, the health of liberal democracy, and future generations.Timely,
    engaging and expertly researched, The Economists' Hour is a reckoning-and a
    call for people to rewrite the rules of the market.

    Studies of political development have traditionally focused on emerging
    countries with the shortest histories and poorest documentary records. This
    book brings the discussion into a realm where the time span is considerable
    and the documentation is vast--the formation of national states in western
    Europe. Through a series of essays on major state-making activities, the
    authors ask what processes and preconditions brought powerful national
    states, rather than some other form of political organization, into a
    dominant position in western Europe. The essays compare the experience of
    major European states between 1500 and 1900 with respect to war-making,
    policing, taxation, control of food supply, and recruitment and training of
    professionals and officials. The aim is to determine how well that
    experience fits available models of political change, especially ideas of
    political development.

  abstract: >-
    We develop a career model of prosecuted misconduct among lawyers. This model
    combines labeling theory's emphasis on the role of sanctions in structuring
    deviant careers with a focus on the asynchronic interaction between life
    cycle changes among precariously positioned actors and system conditions.
    This conceptualization suggests that complaints of misconduct against
    inexperienced solo practitioners are more prone to prosecution because of
    social conceptions and lay theories about lawyer misconduct, perceived
    threats to the profession's public image, and the relative powerlessness of
    these lawyers to defend themselves, especially during economic recession. An
    event history analysis of misconduct complaints against lawyers in a
    Canadian province confirms that complaints against inexperienced solo
    practitioners are more likely to move to prosecution during an economic
    recession. Our findings encourage the application of career
    conceptualizations to other research on deviance.

    The resurgence of antisemitism -- from the deadly Pittsburgh synagogue
    shooting, the alt-right's chant of "Jews will not replace us," up to recent
    controversies within the Women's March and UK Labour Party -- caught many
    observers off guard. Although antisemitism is on the rise in the U.S., it
    has -- until recently -- remained conspicuously absent from progressive/left
    discourse and activism. These recent incidents have restored the term to the
    lexicon of the left, however there remains a tendency to focus exclusively
    on the more deadly antisemitism of the right while remaining silent about
    less deadly manifestations on the left. This article seeks to fill this
    political and analytical void by highlighting this "invisible" form of
    racism, challenging some common assumptions found on the left, and offering
    analytical and political tools rooted in an emancipatory perspective. We
    show that the left has a long and complicated historical relationship with
    antisemitism. By focusing on how antisemitism can manifest in left critiques
    of capitalism or global politics, we illustrate how it both overlaps with
    and diverges from the antisemitism of the right. We use recent examples to
    describe common rhetorical strategies employed to deny or downplay the
    existence of antisemitism within left movements, or derail conversations
    about it from taking place. As antisemitism continues to shape the
    contemporary political landscape, we argue that emancipatory movements must
    become familiar with its specific contours and actively address it in their
    political work.

    With increasing globalization, the meaning and role of the nation-state are
    in flux. At the same time, state theory, which might help to explain such a
    trend, has fallen victim to the general decline of radical movements,
    particularly the crisis in Marxism. This volume seeks to enrich and
    complicate current political debates by bringing state theory back to the
    fore and assessing its relevance to the social phenomena and thought of our
    day. Throughout, it becomes clear that, whether confronting the challenges
    of postmodern and neo-institutionalist theory or the crisis of the welfare
    state and globalization, state theory still has great analytical and
    strategic value.

    We examine the causes of movement and countermovement mobilization, focusing
    specifically on the effect that the national movements have on each other by
    responding directly to mobilization and indirectly through their policy
    successes. We discuss the mechanisms by which national movements respond to
    each other, and we examine the influence of political parties and social,
    political, and economic changes for women. We analyze these relationships
    using a Poisson Autoregressive (PAR(p)) estimator, which is uniquely
    designed to model both the time dependence and the count distributions, on
    quarterly time series of feminist, anti-feminist, pro-choice, and
    anti-abortion events. Results show that movements and countermovements
    respond to each other and that anti-feminist movements mobilize in response
    to national policy change and societal change. The results suggest that many
    quantitative analyses of women's movements may be misspecified and that
    feminist mobilization does not always abate during conservative backlash.

    “A deep accounting of how America got to a point where a median white family
    has 13 times more wealth than the median black family.”―The
    Atlantic“Extraordinary… Baradaran focuses on a part of the American story
    that’s often ignored: the way African Americans were locked out of the
    financial engines that create wealth in America.”―Ezra KleinWhen the
    Emancipation Proclamation was signed in 1863, the black community owned less
    than 1 percent of the total wealth in America. More than 150 years later,
    that number has barely budged. The Color of Money seeks to explain the
    stubborn persistence of this racial wealth gap by focusing on the generators
    of wealth in the black community: black banks.With the civil rights movement
    in full swing, President Nixon promoted “black capitalism,” a plan to
    support black banks and minority-owned businesses. But the catch-22 of black
    banking is that the very institutions needed to help communities escape the
    deep poverty caused by discrimination and segregation inevitably became
    victims of that same poverty. In this timely and eye-opening account,
    Baradaran challenges the long-standing belief that black communities could
    ever really hope to accumulate wealth in a segregated economy.“Black
    capitalism has not improved the economic lives of black people, and
    Baradaran deftly explains the reasons why.”―Los Angeles Review of Books“A
    must read for anyone interested in closing America’s racial wealth
    gap.”―Black Perspectives

    In this article, we begin to respond to the deceptively simple question: How
    do cause lawyers decide when and where to litigate on behalf of their cause?
    We consider the choice of location and timing faced by cause lawyers when
    more than one jurisdiction evinces a suitable legal environment for pursuing
    litigation on their cause. To consider this choice, we use evidence from the
    timing and actions of cause lawyers in the marriage equality cases in the
    United States from January 1990 through December 2004. And, we show the
    value in utilizing methods that are relatively novel in cause lawyering
    research—statistical models—to consider the apparent commonalities, beyond a
    suitable legal environment, across locations and time periods that might
    prompt cause lawyers into action.

    Critical Theories of the State is a clear and accessible survey of radical
    perspectives on the modern state. By focusing on Marxist theory and its
    variations, particularly as applied to advanced industrial societies and
    contemporary welfare states, Clyde W. Barrow provides a more extensive and
    thorough treatment than is available in any other work.  Barrow divides the
    methodological assumptions and key hypotheses of Marxist, Neo-Marxist, and
    Post-Marxist theories into five distinct approaches: instrumentalist,
    structuralist, derivationist, systems-analytic, and organizational realist.
    He categorizes the many theorists discussed in the book, including such
    thinkers as Elmer Altvater, G. William Domhoff, Fred Block, Claus Offe, and
    Theda Skocpol according to their concepts of the state’s relationship to
    capital and their methodological approach to the state. Based on this
    survey, Barrow elaborates a compelling typology of radical state theories
    that identifies with remarkable clarity crucial points of overlap and
    divergence among the various theories.  Scholars conducting research within
    the rubric of state theory, political development, and policy history will
    find Critical Theories of the State an immensely valuable review of the
    literature. Moreover, Barrow’s work will make an excellent textbook for
    undergraduate and graduate courses in political science and sociology, and
    can also be used by those teaching theory courses in international
    relations, history, and political economy.

  abstract: "In-depth study of the  enduring impact of the 1970s debate between state theorists Ralph Miliband and  Nicos Poulantzas.  We have recently lived through the turmoil of a global  financial crisis that originated in the United States and, despite the  platitudes of neo-liberal ideology, nation-states were deeply involved in managing  this crisis. If \x93the state\x94 is again a preeminent actor in the global economy,  then state theory and the problem of the state should also return to the  forefront of political theory. Toward a  Critical Theory of States is an intensive analysis of the 1970s debate  between state theorists Ralph Miliband and Nicos Poulantzas, including its  wider impact on Marxist theories of the state in subsequent decades. Clyde W.  Barrow makes unique arguments and contributions to this continuing discussion  in state theory and lays the foundation for more theoretically informed  empirical and historical research on the state in the age of globalization. He argues  that by merely moving past the Poulantzas-Miliband debate, as some have  recommended, scholars have abandoned much that is valuable in understanding the  state, particularly the need to comprehend the contemporary transformation of  the state form and the state apparatuses as part of the new conditions of  globalization and transnational capital accumulation. Building upon themes of  state restructuring found in Poulantzas and Miliband, Barrow establishes the  outlines of an approach that integrates the thought of both to propose a  synthetic understanding of the new imperialism."

    “I am stunned by the scope and breadth of this splendid new collection of
    sources. It includes memories, stories, letters, poems and more, gathered
    from the pens and the hearts of women who lived and worked in these United
    States. . . . The selections are spell-binding, the introductory material
    illuminating, and the whole a lesson in how the multicultural and
    multiracial experience of work in America has been profoundly affected by
    gender.” ―Alice Kessler-Harris, author of Out to Work A landmark work when
    it appeared in 1976, America's Working Women helped form the field of
    women's studies and transform labor history. Now the authors have enlarged
    the dimensions of this important anthology; more than half the selections
    and all the introductory material are new. Spanning the years from 1600 to
    the present, selections from diaries, popular magazines, historical works,
    oral histories, letters, songs, poetry, and fiction show women's creativity
    in supporting themselves, their families, and organizations or associations.
    Slave women recall their field work, family work, and sabotage. We see
    Indian women farming, and we also see the white culture coercing Indian
    women to give up farming. We see women in industry playing a central part in
    the union movement while facing the particular hazards of women's jobs and
    working conditions. New selections show the historical origins of today's
    important issues: sexual harassment, equal pay, "sex work,” work in the
    underground economy, work in the home, and shift work. With an expanded
    focus on women from all racial and ethnic backgrounds and regions, America's
    Working Women grounds us in the battles women have fought and the ones they
    are in the process of winning.

    Tracing the shifting fortunes and changing character of New York City's
    economic elite over half a century, Sven Beckert brings to light a
    neglected--and critical--chapter in the social history of the U.S.: the rise
    of an American bourgeoisie. The Monied Metropolis is the first comprehensive
    history of New York's economic elite, the most powerful group in
    nineteenth-century America. Beckert explains how a small and diverse group
    of New Yorkers came to wield unprecedented economic, social, and political
    power from 1850 to the turn of the twentieth century. He reveals the central
    role of the Civil War in realigning New York's economic elite, and how the
    New York bourgeoisie reoriented its ideology during Reconstruction,
    abandoning the free labor views of the antebellum years for laissez-faire
    liberalism. Sven Beckert is the Dunwalke Associate at Harvard University. He
    is the recipient of several honors and fellowships, including the Aby
    Warburg Foundation prize for academic excellence, a MacArthur Dissertation
    Fellowship and a Andrew W. Mellon fellowship. This is his first book.

    Much recent sociolegal scholarship focuses on hegemony and resistance to it.
    In this scholarship, hegemony is broadly understood as power that maintains
    and naturalizes existing social structures; resistance refers to actions
    that lay bare the historical and constructed nature of these social
    arrangements and the inequalities they generate and sustain. This literature
    has generated many important insights regarding law as a source of both
    hegemony and resistance; yet . . . most such studies focus on everyday acts
    of resistance or the resistance of ordinary citizens in administrative

    When the landmark Supreme Court case of Brown vs. Board of Education was
    handed down in 1954, many civil rights advocates believed that the decision
    finding public school segregation unconstitutional could become the Holy
    Grail of racial justice. Fifty years later, despite its legal irrelevance
    and the racially separate and educationally ineffective state of public
    schooling for most black children, Brown is still viewed by many as the
    perfect precedent.Derrick Bell here shatters this shining image of one of
    the Court's most celebrated rulings. He notes that, despite the onerous
    burdens of segregation, many black schools functioned well and racial
    bigotry had not rendered blacks a damaged race. Brown's recognition of
    racial injustice, without more, left racial barriers intact. Given what we
    now know about the pervasive nature of racism, the Court should have
    determined--for the first time--to rigorously enforce the "equal" component
    of the "separate but equal" standard.By striking it down, the Court intended
    both to improve the Nation's international image during the Cold War and
    offer blacks recognition that segregation was wrong. Instead, the Brown
    decision actually enraged and energized its opponents. It stirred confusion
    and conflict into the always vexing question of race in a society that,
    despite denials and a frustratingly flexible amnesia, owes much of its
    growth, development, and success, to the ability of those who dominate the
    society to use race to both control and exploit most people, black and
    white.Racial policy, Bell maintains, is made through silent
    covenants--unspoken convergences of interest and involuntary sacrifices of
    rights--that ensure that policies conform to priorities set by
    policy-makers. Blacks and whites are the fortuitous winners or losers in
    these unspoken agreements.The experience with Brown, Bell urges, should
    teach us that meaningful progress in the quest for racial justice requires
    more than the assertion of harms. Strategies must recognize and utilize the
    interest-convergence factors that strongly influence racial policy
    decisions. In Silent Covenants, Bell condenses more than four decades of
    thought and action into a powerful and eye-opening book.

  abstract: "From the Preface: The world in which we live has its roots far back in history, and as a world power America must come to terms with countries which were formed in their present mold long before the American, revolution. All those to whom an exploration of this historical background will appeal probably share with me an immediate empathy with the anguish of nation-building around the world. This book is a study of what that anguish meant in times past when countries were first developing their political institutions and when they turned more recently from royal authority to a popular mandate. The problems of developing such institutions are formidable, then as well as now. A scholarly concern with these problems must touch on many subjects in social stratification, religion, political sociology, and the history of ideas, and the book treats these and related themes in their specific historical contexts.\_This interpretive work is addressed not only to students of political development but also to the general reader who is interested in a large view of history. That reader is provided with sufficient detail and annotation so that the many diverse contexts with which this study deals can be understood. A thematic outline of the book is presented on the first pages of the introduction, which deals as well with the reasons for my approach to historical sociology."

    New municipalism, in its endeavour to democratise urban politics and policy,
    employs innovative strategies including public–common partnerships, which
    seek to support citizens in self-managing public goods and services.
    Proponents of new municipalism claim that these partnerships have a
    democratising capacity, as self-management is seen as an expression of
    direct democracy. In this article we examine this democratising capacity. By
    adopting an abductive methodology, the article analyses a case of a
    public–common partnership, the Citizen Assets programme promoted by
    Barcelona en Comú in Barcelona, Spain. The research findings show that the
    Citizen Assets programme does have a democratising capacity. However,
    democratisation is not achieved exclusively through self-management, which
    itself needs to be democratised, but by integrating different modalities of
    democratisation into the policy process, namely co-production and democratic
    control. Theorising this integration as a ‘non-appropriable’ form of policy
    making, the article makes an original contribution to research on
    democratisation in the context of a specific new municipalism-inspired
    policy programme.

    "The concept of "The Least Dangerous Branch: the Supreme Court at the Bar of
    Politics" is something of a departure from all recent literature on the
    Supreme Court. The book attempts to state and substantiate a conception of
    the Supreme Court of the United States that is consistent with the theory
    and practice of political democracy. The author focuses on the Court's
    complex relationship with the nation's political institutions, in the
    context not only of what are conventionally regarded as great Constitutional
    cases, but also of jurisdictional and other adjudications that are usually
    ignored. Detailed treatment is given to cases concerned with film
    censorship, anti-birth-control legislation, Congressional investigations,
    loyalty and security dismissals, legislative apportionment, and
    segregation."

    Alberto Melucci, in his book *Nomads of the Present,* pointed to a gap in
    current ways of studying social movements. According to Melucci,
    structuralist theories try to explain collective protest by discovering the
    strains in social systems. In so doing, the structuralist approach fails to
    describe how social movements are established. On the other hand, resource
    mobilization theorists devote their attention to examining how collective
    action is accomplished. In their turn, such theorists overlook the meaning
    of collective action for the participants. Melucci argues that both
    approaches ignore how social movements produce new collective identities and
    cognitive interpretations. He claims

    The U.S. trade union movement finds itself today on a global battlefield
    filled with landmines and littered with the bodies of various social
    movements and struggles. Candid, incisive, and accessible, Solidarity
    Divided is a critical examination of labor's current crisis and a plan for a
    bold new way forward into the twenty-first century. Bill Fletcher and
    Fernando Gapasin, two longtime union insiders whose experiences as activists
    of color grant them a unique vantage on the problems now facing U.S. labor,
    offer a remarkable mix of vivid history and probing analysis. They chart
    changes in U.S. manufacturing, examine the onslaught of globalization,
    consider the influence of the environment on labor, and provide the first
    broad analysis of the fallout from the 2000 and 2004 elections on the U.S.
    labor movement. Ultimately calling for a wide-ranging reexamination of the
    ideological and structural underpinnings of today's labor movement, this is
    essential reading for understanding how the battle for social justice can be
    fought and won.

    In “Complicity and Lesser Evils: A Tale of Two Lawyers,” David Luban
    considers the dilemma of a decent person employed by the government or
    offered a government position in an evil regime. Through an analysis of two
    legal advisors in the Third Reich, Bernhard Lo¨sener and Helmuth James von
    Moltke, who remained on the job and arguably saved lives, Luban challenges
    Hannah Arendt’s contention that remaining in office in these conditions is
    necessarily to support the regime. In this response, we remain within
    Luban’s primarily consequentialist perspective, and ask, like him, whether
    any good can be done by lawyers staying on the job. However, we challenge
    his analytical framework for being overly individualist and agentist. We
    argue that, if we expand our perspective to the structure of evil regimes
    and the ways they inflict harm, we will notice important consequences of
    remaining and leaving that Luban fails to take into account. In particular,
    we argue that understanding the complex part played by legal institutions
    and legal discourse in authoritarian and semi-authoritarian regimes would
    lead to the realization that lawyers face a particularly sharp dilemma in
    such regimes, as both their possibilities of doing good and of strengthening
    the regime are strong. We proceed in three steps. First, we show that
    Luban’s analysis is narrowly focused on individual agency. We then draw on
    scholarship on the Third Reich, bureaucratic crimes, and authoritarian uses
    of law to outline the structural characteristics and legal foundations of
    authoritarian wrongs. Finally, equipped with this theoretical background, we
    analyze anew the lawyer’s dilemma. Applying a structural perspective
    cognizant of the role of law in repression to the stories of Lo¨sener and
    Moltke as well as of two other lawyers in the Third Reich, Ernst Fraenkel
    and Georg Konrad Morgen, we argue that the lawyer’s dilemma is more
    difficult to resolve than Luban suggests.

  abstract: >-
    An indispensable window into the changing shape of the American working
    class and American politicsThirteen months after Trump allegedly captured
    the allegiance of “the white working class,” a strike wave—the first in over
    four decades—rocked the United States. Inspired by the wildcat victory in
    West Virginia, teachers in Oklahoma, Arizona, and across the country walked
    off their jobs and shut down their schools to demand better pay for
    educators, more funding for students, and an end to years of austerity.
    Confounding all expectations, these working-class rebellions erupted in
    regions with Republican electorates, weak unions, and bans on public sector
    strikes. By mobilizing to take their destinies into their own hands, red
    state school workers posed a clear alternative to politics as usual. And
    with similar actions now gaining steam in Los Angeles, Oakland, Denver, and
    Virginia, there is no sign that this upsurge will be short-lived. Red State
    Revolt is a compelling analysis of the emergence and development of this
    historic strike wave, with an eye to extracting its main strategic lessons
    for educators, labor organizer, and radicals across the country. A former
    high school teacher and longtime activist, Eric Blanc embedded himself into
    the rank-and-file leaderships of the walkouts, where he was given access to
    internal organizing meetings and secret Facebook groups inaccessible to most
    journalists. The result is one of the richest portraits of the labor
    movement to date, a story populated with the voices of school workers who
    are winning the fight for the soul of public education—and redrawing the
    political map of the country at large.

    Clinical legal education is playing an increasingly important role in
    educating lawyers worldwide. In The Global Clinical Movement: Educating
    Lawyers for Social Justice, editor Frank S. Bloch and contributors describe
    the central concepts, goals, and methods of clinical legal education from a
    global perspective, with a particular emphasis on its social justice
    mission. With chapters written by leading clinical legal educators from
    every region of the world, The Global Clinical Movement demonstrates how the
    emerging global clinical movement can advance social justice through legal
    education. Professor Bloch and the contributors also examine the influence
    of clinical legal education on the legal academy and the legal profession
    and chart the global clinical movement's future role in educating lawyers
    for social justice. The Global Clinical Movement consists of three parts.
    Part I describes clinical legal education programs from every region of the
    world and discusses those qualities that are unique to a particular country
    or region. Part II discusses the various ways that clinical programs and the
    clinical methodology advance the cause of social justice around the world.
    Part III analyzes the current state of the global clinical movement and sets
    out an agenda for the movement to advance social justice through socially
    relevant legal education.

  abstract: >-
    Socialist Review Book Award, Socialist Review, 1987 This volume makes
    available in one place a complete statement of Fred Block's perspective for
    students and participants in the ongoing debate on state theory. His
    substantial Introduction serves as an intellectual autobiography in which he
    assesses the field-including the theories of Domhoff, Poulantzas, and
    Skocpoland situates his own work within it. Block also discusses his
    relationship to different strands of Marxism. In his analysis of the
    relationship between business and the state, Block argues that while
    business interests have far more influence over state policy than other
    constituencies, state actors still have substantial autonomy in formulating
    policies. In particular, the business community's internal divisions and
    difficulties in assessing its own interests limit its capacity to control
    events. Block insists that when business influence is greatest, as during
    the Reagan years, state policies will be least successful in solving the
    society's problems. "What is at work here is a relatively simple
    sociological dynamic--that institutionalized relations of power tend to
    become visible only when they weaken. When these institutionalized relations
    are most effective, they tend to be invisible, precisely because the
    justifying ideologies so dominate people's commonsense understandings. The
    classic recent example is the existence of women's subordination. In the
    fifties, people would have responded to the claim that women were
    systematically discriminated against in American society with incredulity
    because they had so totally accepted an ideology that justified differential
    treatment of men and women as normal and natural. The full-blown analysis
    and critique of male domination emerges only in the seventies, when
    patriarchal arrangements are already weakening.... "In state theory, the
    development is analogous. In the fifties, pluralist arguments dominate
    because the exercise of power has been rendered invisible. The relation
    between business and the state works so well that it leaves few traces.
    Moreover, there is little real debate about how the society should be
    structured, so the extent to which everyone's basic assumptions fit with the
    interests of corporate capitalism is not at all obvious. Since nobody was
    even asking the big questions of who should make investment decisions and
    how should income and wealth be distributed, it was not apparent that the
    narrow limits of debate fit exactly with the interests of business....
    However, the cumulative impact of Vietnam and racial conflict in the late
    sixties, the drama of Watergate, and the growing economic difficulties of
    advanced capitalist societies in the early seventies served to make the
    exercise of power in American society widely visible. The previous
    functional relation between the state and business had been disrupted and
    the efforts by each side to advocate its own interests became more
    apparent." --From the Introduction

    The framers of the Constitution chose their words carefully when they wrote
    of a more perfect union—not absolutely perfect, but with room for
    improvement. Indeed, we no longer operate under the same Constitution as
    that ratified in 1788, or even the one completed by the Bill of Rights in
    1791—because we are no longer the same nation. In The Revolutionary
    Constitution, David J. Bodenhamer provides a comprehensive new look at
    America's basic law, integrating the latest legal scholarship with
    historical context to highlight how it has evolved over time. The
    Constitution, he notes, was the product of the first modern revolution, and
    revolutions are, by definition, moments when the past shifts toward an
    unfamiliar future, one radically different from what was foreseen only a
    brief time earlier. In seeking to balance power and liberty, the framers
    established a structure that would allow future generations to continually
    readjust the scale. Bodenhamer explores this dynamic through seven major
    constitutional themes: federalism, balance of powers, property,
    representation, equality, rights, and security. With each, he takes a
    historical approach, following their changes over time. For example, the
    framers wrote multiple protections for property rights into the Constitution
    in response to actions by state governments after the Revolution. But
    twentieth-century courts—and Congress—redefined property rights through
    measures such as zoning and the designation of historical landmarks
    (diminishing their commercial value) in response to the needs of a modern
    economy. The framers anticipated just such a future reworking of their own
    compromises between liberty and power. With up-to-the-minute legal expertise
    and a broad grasp of the social and political context, this book is a tour
    de force of Constitutional history and analysis.

    The Nazi ideologue Arthur Rosenberg formulated the essence of modern

    Bolshevism, and “Jewish capitalism,” by which he and his fellow antisemites,
    then and now, understand a capitalism not of productive labor and industry
    but of parasites: money and finance, speculators and bankers.¹  There is of
    course a difference between the antisemitism that culminated in Auschwitz
    and the antisemitism of the post-1945 world. However, whether antisemitism
    persists because of or despite Auschwitz is ultimately an idle question. The
    terms *despite* and *because* give credence to the notion that Auschwitz,

    The paper argues that the critique of modern antisemitism is fundamentally a
    critique of capitalist political economy. It expounds the critical tradition
    associated with the work of Marx, Horkheimer, Adorno and Postone, to argue
    that antisemitism is innate to the existent society. It explores
    antisemitism as a perverted form of anti-capitalism, one which associates
    labour economy with freedom, Arbeit macht frei, and rejects the
    manifestation of labour economy in the form of money as more money. It
    specifies antisemitism as a personalised critique of a crisis-ridden dynamic
    of real economic abstractions, of price and profit, and their regulation by
    the invisible hand. Modern antisemitism identifies the ghostlike character
    of the economic object, what Marx called the capital fetish, with the
    character and the power of the Jew.

  abstract: >-
    The ‘resolutions movement’ – a popular political mobilisation guided by
    lawyers, and expressed in exclusively legal terms and orientated towards
    legal objectives – has been an important expression of popular resistance to
    contemporary US counterterrorism policy. This article uses the resolutions
    movement as a vehicle for critically evaluating the cause lawyer literature
    and for reconceptualising ‘cause lawyers’. The article discusses two
    different approaches to the political implications of lawyering. The first
    approach draws on the ‘cause-lawyering’ literature that appears initially as
    a perfect context for analysing the movement. However, detailed examination
    shows this approach to be premised on a strong dichotomy between law and
    politics, something that impedes analysis. To overcome the resulting aporia,
    a ‘strategic-relational’ approach, which sees both law and politics as
    social relations and practices, is proposed as an alternative. This allows a
    more nuanced discussion of the law–politics relation that facilitates
    analysis of the movement and leads to a set of proposals capable of enabling
    cause-lawyering studies to transcend its conceptual rigidity.

    Social science literature tends to assume a link between national policies
    and local civil societies. Although that model may represent Western nations
    reasonably well, its extension to African nations and other countries in the
    Southern Hemisphere is often problematic. Such analyses miss an important
    piece of the picture: the international context of national action.
    Examining the evolution of laws from power struggles within countries
    reifies the nation-state and misses larger issues of control in the
    international system.  An examination of the practice and policies of female
    genital cutting (FGC) provides an interesting case to explore the importance
    of international culture

    This article argues that "Cultural Marxism" is an antisemitic conspiracy
    theory, by drawing from three of the main proponents of the theory in the
    United States today. According to the conspiracy theory, the Jewish Marxists
    of the Frankfurt School implemented a slow takeover of "culture," seeking to
    undermine Christianity, family, and nation in favor of a new worldview and
    system of control, involving mass immigration, sexual liberation, and moral
    and aesthetic decline. Cultural Marxists, the conspiracy theorists believe,
    now control all areas of public life, including the media, schools,
    entertainment, the economy, and national and global systems of governance.
    Not only does this theory vastly overestimate the influence of a small group
    of intellectuals, the conspiracy theory trades on the Frankfurt School's
    perceived Jewishness and amplifies antisemitic tropes. This article focuses
    on three of the main proponents of the Cultural Marxism conspiracy
    theory--white nationalist Kevin MacDonald and self-titled
    paleo-conservatives William S. Lind and Paul Gottfried--showing how the work
    of each on the Frankfurt School amplifies antisemitic tropes and engages in
    conspiracy thinking that misrepresents the Frankfurt School's ideas and
    influence.

    At a time when the American labor movement is mobilizing for a major
    resurgence through new organizing, here, at last, is a book about research
    on union organizing strategies. Previous studies have focused on factors
    contributing to union decline, devoting little attention to the organizing
    process itself. The twenty chapters in this volume dramatically increase
    understanding of the range and effectiveness of new organizing strategies
    and their potential contribution to the revitalization of the labor
    movement.The introduction defines the context of the current organizing
    climate. Major sections of the book cover strategic initiatives in union
    organizing, overcoming barriers to worker support for unions,
    community-based organizing, building membership and public support for
    organizing, and organizing initiatives by industry or by sector. Individual
    chapters focus on topics such as organizing outside the NLRB process, the
    role of clergy, local labor councils, and rank-and-file volunteer
    organizers.

    Brudney, Schiavoni, and Merritt address an important debate dividing lawyers
    and political scientists: To what extent do extradoctrinal factors such as
    political party, gender, and professional experience influence judicial
    decisionmaking? They analyze an area of law, decisions interpreting the
    National Labor Relations Act, that has long been characterized by assertions
    of judicial bias. By including every federal court of appeals decision
    applying the Act over a seven-year period, and controlling for both
    deference to the administrative agency and differences among issues arising
    under the Act, the authors are able to identify previously undetected
    influences on judicial decisionmaking. These include a strong interaction
    between gender and political party, the influence of prior experience
    representing management clients under the Act, and associations based on
    race, religion, and educational background. At the same time, the authors
    place those influences in context, suggesting the complex interweaving of
    doctrine and personal background in shaping judicial decisions.

    beloved American radical, labor leader, and socialist Eugene Victor Debs led
    the Socialist Party to federal and state office across the United States by
    the 1920s. Imprisoned for speaking out against World War I, Debs ran for
    president from prison on the Socialist Party ticket, receiving over 1
    million votes. Debs’s life is a story of labor battles in industrializing
    America, of a fighting socialist politics grown directly out of the Midwest
    heartland, and of a distinctly American vision of socialism.

    The stories of the hard-rock miners’ shooting wars, young Elizabeth Gurly
    Flynn (the “Rebel Girl” of contemporary sheet music), the first sit-down
    strikes and Free Speech fights, Emma Goldman and the struggle for birth
    control access, the Pageant for Paterson orchestrated in Madison Square
    Garden, bohemian radicals John Reed and Louise Bryant, field-hand revolts
    and lumber workers’ strikes, wartime witch hunts, government prosecutions
    and mob lynching, Mexican-American uprisings in Baja, and Mexican peasant
    revolts led by Wobblies, hilarious and sentimental songs created and later
    revived—all are here, and much, much more. The IWW, which has been
    organizing workers since 1905, is often cited yet elusive to scholars
    because of its eclectic and controversial cultural and social character.
    Wobblies! presents the IWW whole, scripted and drawn by old-time and younger
    Wobbly and IWW-inspired artists. Contributors include Carlos Cortez (former
    editor of the Industrial Worker), Harvey Pekar (author of American
    Splendor), Peter Kuper (MAD’s Spy vs. Spy), Sue Coe, Seth Tobocman, Chris
    Cardinale, Ryan Inzana, Spain Rodriques, Trina Robbins, Sharon Rudahl, and

    As an introduction to the topic of anti-Semitism, this article brings
    together the common issues that lead to the conceptual complexity of
    anti-Semitism. The breach of anti-Semitism into public politics and the
    organized left through the two-axis points of Israel and conspiracy theories
    are discussed, in particular recent controversies in the Labour Party,
    attacks on religious centers, and discordant views on what qualifies as
    anti-Semitism. Weaving together personal narratives, the essay unpacks the
    difficulty of considering anti-Semitism in the contemporary understanding of
    oppression, colonialism, and white supremacy.

    Conducted through archival research of primary documents including period
    newspaper articles, meeting notes, and political pamphlets at the Oregon
    Historical Society, this article investigates the development of inter-war
    fascism in Oregon as a key inflection point in the germination of the modern
    white power movement. Contrasting the novel organization and dissemination
    of inter-war fascism in Oregon with the earlier rise of the Ku Klux Klan,
    this research illustrates the influences of European ideological currents on
    the domestic far right as it attempted to consolidate dispersed networks of
    ethnic interest groups and political leaders into a radical force for
    change. We track the successes and failures of the fascist movement as its
    followers integrated within the ranks of law enforcement and public
    officials, and the impact of the Second World War on their ensuing,
    conflictive relationship with the federal government. Our findings indicate
    that the inter-war fascist movement in Oregon saw the broadening of U.S.
    "Americanism" to include Catholics and immigrants while simultaneously
    seeing its numbers dwindle. This emergence of a more inclusive sense of
    whiteness, combined with resentment against the federal government following
    the Second World War, produced new conceptualizations of "white nationalism"
    and "white power" as revolutionary slogans far removed from the
    politically-powerful, populist mass movement that the Klan created in the
    1920s. However, we argue that political marginalization of rural areas by
    the left only reifies the popularization of the far-right Patriot movement
    as an "outsider force," normalizing fascist ideology in the process.

    If the American labor movement is to rise again, it will not be as a result
    of electing different politicians, the passage of legislation, or improved
    methods of union organizing. Rather, workers will need to rediscover the
    power of the strike. Not the ineffectual strike of today, where employees
    meekly sit on picket lines waiting for scabs to take their jobs, but the
    type of strike capable of grinding industries to a halt—the kind employed up
    until the 1960s.In Reviving the Strike, labor lawyer Joe Burns draws on
    economics, history and current analysis in arguing that the labor movement
    must redevelop an effective strike based on the now outlawed traditional
    labor tactics of stopping production and workplace-based solidarity. The
    book challenges the prevailing view that tactics such as organizing workers
    or amending labor law can save trade unionism in this country. Instead,
    Reviving the Strike offers a fundamentally different solution to the current
    labor crisis, showing how collective bargaining backed by a strike capable
    of inflicting economic harm upon an employer is the only way for workers to
    break free of the repressive system of labor control that has been imposed
    upon them by corporations and the government for the past seventy-five
    years.

    “There is no collective bargaining without the strike. Joe Burns’ Strike
    Back helps awaken the labor movement to our collective power. This book
    belongs in the hands of every unionist who wants to build power for working
    people through militant grassroots activism." ―SARA NELSON, President of the
    Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO During the 1960s and 1970s,
    teachers, police, firefighters, sanitation workers and many other public
    employees rose up to demand collective bargaining rights in one of the
    greatest upsurges in labor history. These workers were able to transform the
    nature of public employment, winning union recognition for millions and
    ultimately forcing reluctant politicians to pass laws allowing for
    collective bargaining and even the right to strike. Strike Back uncovers
    this history of militancy to provide tactics for a new generation of public
    employees facing unprecedented attacks on their labor rights. This newly
    updated edition discusses many significant recent developments for public
    employee unions, including the Supreme Court decision in Janus and the 2018
    teacher strike wave. Featuring a foreword by Eric Blanc, author of Red State
    Revolt: The Teachers’ Strike Wave and Working-Class Politics.

    Law and society is a rapidly growing field that turns the conventional view
    of law as mythical abstraction on its head. Kitty Calavita brilliantly
    brings to life the ways in which law is found not only in statutes and
    courtrooms but in our institutions and interactions, while inviting readers
    into conversations that introduce the field’s dominant themes and most
    lively disagreements. Deftly interweaving scholarship with familiar
    examples, Calavita shows how scholars in the discipline are collectively
    engaged in a subversive exposé of law’s public mythology. While surveying
    prominent issues and distinctive approaches to both law as it is written and
    actual legal practices, as well as the law’s potential as a tool for social
    change, this volume provides a view of law that is more real but just as
    compelling as its mythic counterpart.  With this second edition of
    Invitation to Law and Society, Calavita brings up to date what is arguably
    the leading introduction to this exciting, evolving field of inquiry and
    adds a new chapter on the growing law and cultural studies movement.

  abstract: >-
    On 10 February 1999, Italy’s highest court of appeals overturned the
    conviction of a driving instructor who had allegedly raped his 18-year-old
    student. The Corte di Cassazione reasoned that the young woman was wearing
    blue jeans at the time, so the sexual intercourse must have been consensual.
    The Justices proclaimed, “It is impossible to take off jeans . . . without
    the active cooperation of the person wearing them.” The decision set off a
    wave of protest across the political spectrum in Italy and around the world.

    The empirical study of law, legal systems and legal institutions is widely
    viewed as one of the most exciting and important intellectual developments
    in the modern history of legal research. Motivated by a conviction that
    legal phenomena can and should be understood not only in normative terms but
    also as social practices of political, economic and ethical significance,
    empirical legal researchers have used quantitative and qualitative methods
    to illuminate many aspects of law's meaning, operation and impact.  In the
    43 chapters of The Oxford Handbook of Empirical Legal Research leading
    scholars provide accessible and original discussions of the history, aims
    and methods of empirical research about law, as well as its achievements and
    potential. The Handbook has three parts. The first deals with the
    development and institutional context of empirical legal research. The
    second - and largest - part consists of critical accounts of empirical
    research on many aspects of the legal world - on criminal law, civil law,
    public law, regulatory law and international law; on lawyers, judicial
    institutions, legal procedures and evidence; and on legal pluralism and the
    public understanding of law. The third part introduces readers to the
    methods of empirical research, and its place in the law school curriculum.

    The phenomenon of national identities, always a key issue in the modern
    history of Bohemian Jewry, was particularly complex because of the marginal
    differences that existed between the available choices. Considerable overlap
    was evident in the programs of the various national movements and it was
    possible to change one’s national identity or even to opt for more than one
    such identity without necessarily experiencing any far-reaching consequences
    in everyday life. Based on many hitherto unknown archival sources from the
    Czech Republic, Israel and Austria, the author’s research reveals the inner
    dynamic of each of the national movements and maps out the three most
    important constructions of national identity within Bohemian Jewry – the
    German-Jewish, the Czech-Jewish and the Zionist. This book provides a needed
    framework for understanding the rich history of German- and Czech-Jewish
    politics and culture in Bohemia and is a notable contribution to the
    historiography of Bohemian, Czechoslovak and central European Jewry.

    Prague's magnificent synagogues and Old Jewish Cemetery attract millions of
    visitors each year, and travelers who venture beyond the capital find
    physical evidence of once vibrant Jewish communities in towns and villages
    throughout today's Czech Republic. For those seeking to learn more about the
    people who once lived and died at those sites, however, there has until now
    been no comprehensive account in English of the region's Jews.Prague and
    Beyond presents a new and accessible history of the Jews of the Bohemian
    Lands written by an international team of scholars. It offers a multifaceted
    account of the Jewish people in a region that has been, over the centuries,
    a part of the Holy Roman Empire and the Habsburg Monarchy, was constituted
    as the democratic Czechoslovakia in the years following the First World War,
    became the Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and later a postwar
    Communist state, and is today's Czech Republic. This ever-changing landscape
    provides the backdrop for a historical reinterpretation that emphasizes the
    rootedness of Jews in the Bohemian Lands, the intricate variety of their
    social, economic, and cultural relationships, their negotiations with state
    power, the connections that existed among Jewish communities, and the close,
    if often conflictual, ties between Jews and their non-Jewish
    neighbors.Prague and Beyond is written in a narrative style with a focus on
    several unifying themes across the periods. These include migration and
    mobility; the shape of social networks; religious life and education; civic
    rights, citizenship, and Jewish autonomy; gender and the family; popular
    culture; and memory and commemorative practices. Collectively these
    perspectives work to revise conventional understandings of Central Europe's
    Jewish past and present, and more fully capture the diversity and
    multivalence of life in the Bohemian Lands.

    Martin Carnoy clarifies the important contemporary debate on the social role
    of an increasingly complex State. He analyzes the most recent recasting of
    Marxist political theories in continental Europe, the Third World, and the
    United States; sets the new theories in a context of past thinking about the
    State; and argues for the existence of a major shift in Marxist
    views.Originally published in 1984.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the
    latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously
    out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University
    Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books
    while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal
    of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich
    scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton
    University Press since its founding in 1905.

    "Lucid, deeply informed, and enlivened with striking illustrations." -Noam
    ChomskyOne economist has called Ha-Joon Chang "the most exciting thinker our
    profession has turned out in the past fifteen years." With Bad Samaritans,
    this provocative scholar bursts into the debate on globalization and
    economic justice. Using irreverent wit, an engagingly personal style, and a
    battery of examples, Chang blasts holes in the "World Is Flat" orthodoxy of
    Thomas Friedman and other liberal economists who argue that only unfettered
    capitalism and wide-open international trade can lift struggling nations out
    of poverty. On the contrary, Chang shows, today's economic superpowers-from
    the U.S. to Britain to his native Korea-all attained prosperity by shameless
    protectionism and government intervention in industry. We have conveniently
    forgotten this fact, telling ourselves a fairy tale about the magic of free
    trade and-via our proxies such as the World Bank, International Monetary
    Fund, and World Trade Organization-ramming policies that suit ourselves down
    the throat of the developing world. Unlike typical economists who construct
    models of how the marketplace should work, Chang examines the past: what has
    actually happened. His pungently contrarian history demolishes one pillar
    after another of free-market mythology. We treat patents and copyrights as
    sacrosanct-but developed our own industries by studiously copying others'
    technologies. We insist that centrally planned economies stifle growth-but
    many developing countries had higher GDP growth before they were pressured
    into deregulating their economies. Both justice and common sense, Chang
    argues, demand that we reevaluate the policies we force on nations that are
    struggling to follow in our footsteps.

    In 1917, Congress created the status of temporary labor migrant. A new kind
    of restricted worker born from nineteenth‐century free labor politics,
    employer and citizen worker demands under modern liberal capitalism, and
    state labor market regulation, temporary migrants have always had an
    employer‐dependent legal status and been subject to deportation. Yet, since
    1942, changing rights and legal processes have governed migrant employment
    termination across sectors. By drawing on employment cases from archival and
    unpublished files made available to me under FOIA, and court decisions, I
    compare the impact of laws of employment termination on deportable laborers
    beginning in 1942, when government agencies planned migration, and under
    privatized migration after 1964. From agriculture and war to today's service
    and knowledge economies, I demonstrate how employment rights have always
    shaped deportable workers' legal status. Yet, I also show how today's rights
    and legal processes, in contrast to the past, hardly mitigate employer
    control over migrants under contemporary capitalism.

    After the 2016 election, commentators published a flurry of essays with
    advice on whether lawyers and federal officials should remain in government
    during the Trump administration. In this article, I review those essays,
    including Professor David Luban’s stern advice about the risk of remaining.
    I also discuss three key concepts from Professor Luban’s article for this
    symposium: desk perpetrators, desk mitigators, and operational maneuvering
    room, and explore how they apply to Trump administration officials who
    engaged in internal resistance or principled resignation. More than one
    hundred federal officials in the administration engaged in principled
    resignation, many acting in concert with each other. The power of concerted
    action is most evident when a group of powerful officials together threaten
    to resign as a way of deterring abusive conduct. Many of these officials
    wrote letters or op-eds explaining their decision to resign, often sounding
    in the language of morality, emphasizing their disagreement with Trump
    policies and rhetoric they found repugnant.

    The 1990s promise to be a period of rapid political change, as old political
    boundaries dissolve and new political forces emerge. These changes throw
    into question our understanding of capitalism and socialism, of the
    character of the nation state, and of the relationship between the economy
    and the state. However, these changes are only the culmination of
    developments which have been unfolding over the past two decades. This book
    includes a comprehensive introductory survey, which sets the contributions
    collected here within the context of the wider debate.

    Designed to encourage critical thinking about history, the MAJOR PROBLEMS IN
    AMERICAN HISTORY series introduces you to both primary sources and
    analytical essays on important topics in U.S. history. This collection
    serves as the primary anthology for the introductory survey course, covering
    the subject's entire chronological span. Comprehensive topical coverage
    includes politics, economics, labor, gender, culture, and social trends. The
    fourth edition has been revised to reflect two new historiographical trends:
    the emergence of the history of religion as an exceptionally lively field
    and the internationalization of American history. Several chapters include
    images, songs, and poems to give you a better "feel" for the time period and
    events under discussion. Key pedagogical elements of the Major Problems
    format have been retained: chapter introductions, headnotes, and suggested
    readings.

    Conflicts pervade society, and legal institutions provide means of resolving
    those conflicts. The role courts play in society depends in part on when
    (and why) people seek out these institutions to resolve disputes. Over the
    years, researchers from several disciplines have extensively examined what
    leads people to step outside their ordinary patterns of interacting to
    resolve disputes through litigation. Past research provides remarkably
    consistent findings: Litigation usually arises as a last resort, signaling
    either a breakdown in social relationships or a lack of close relationships
    at the outset (e.g., Macaulay 1963; Galanter 1983; Ellickson 1991). Most
    people do not rush

  abstract: "Founded in 1905, Chicago’s Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) is a union unlike any other. With members affectionately called “Wobblies” and an evolutionary and internationalist philosophy and tactics, it rapidly grew across the world. Considering the history of the IWW from an international perspective for the first time, Wobblies of the World brings together a group of leading scholars to present a lively collection of accounts from thirteen diverse countries, revealing a fascinating story of anarchism, syndicalism, and socialism. \_ Drawing on many important figures of the movement—Har Dayal, James Larkin, William D. “Big Bill” Haywood, Enrique Flores Magón, and more—the contributors describe how the IWW and its ideals spread, exploring the crucial role the IWW played in industries such as shipping, mining, and agriculture. Ultimately, the book illuminates Wobblie methods of organizing, forms of expression, practices, and transnational issues, offering a fascinating alternative history of the group."

    Representing Radicals helps lawyers understand ways to work with radical
    defendants, with an explicit focus on how to help them achieve ends that go
    beyond traditional legal goals. For example, many radical defendants want to
    use their trials to discuss political issues even if doing so could lead to
    a conviction when a standard criminal defense might lead to an acquittal.
    Understanding radical defendants’ goals and political priorities is a
    crucial part of providing them with the most robust criminal defense while
    helping them strengthen and defend their social movements. This book and its
    precursor, A Tilted Guide to Being a Defendant, are based on the Tilted
    Scales Collective’s belief that lawyers and radical defendants can work
    together in shared struggle in ways that strengthen movements when fighting
    criminal charges.

    remedies that would mend soured relationships and respond to their personal

    This article examines the decision to initiate litigation in the dispute
    settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Prior empirical
    research has focused on determinants of participation in WTO disputing but
    without full consideration of the social processes by which the decision to
    litigate is made. To the extent that these processes have been subject to
    study, scholars have presumed that initiation of a formal WTO dispute
    results from a cost-benefit analysis, and they have conceived of dispute
    initiation as a way to force “renegotiation” of a trade relationship,
    eliminate inefficiency caused by protectionist trade policies, and yield
    outcomes

  abstract: >-
    The proliferation of research on the US labor movement has created
    opportunities for the development of theory on labor action. Such theory
    would account for variations in the development, structure, ideology, goals,
    functions, social composition, and societal impact of labor unions and, more
    generally, the labor movement. This review of recent sociological research
    focuses on two sets of enduring questions to which this research has been
    addressed. The first concerns the development of the U.S. labor
    movement--that is, its connection to industrialization; its internal
    organizational and ideological development; and worker predispositions to
    unionize and conduct strikes. The second pertains to the socioeconomic and
    political impact of the U.S. labor movement--i.e. its impact on worker
    livelihoods and life chances and social inequality, as well as its
    universalizing effects on the determinants of inequality; and, its impact on
    working class political participation and the shaping of social policy. This
    review concludes with suggestions for redirecting research in order to
    realize the growing opportunities for developing theory on labor action.

    This is one of the classic texts of historical sociology and will be
    welcomed by all students of modern state formation. Corrigan and Sayer's
    illuminating analysis of the development of the English state from the
    eleventh to the late nineteenth centuries profoundly challenges conventional
    wisdoms, showing that state formation is cultural revolution, and moral
    regulation is fundamental to state power.

    Broad ranging in its coverage of the liberal democratic state and other,
    non-democratic state formations, the book offers chapters on each of the
    core theories of the modern state. Each chapter is structured in the same
    way to allow for ease of cross-referencing and for comparisons to be drawn
    between theories, with parts on Context, Definition, Theorists and Practical
    Politics.  The authors work on the premise that theory is relevant to
    everyday life, helping us to understand current political transitions and
    institutional formations and practices. Taking a practical view of politics,
    each chapter illustrates how state theory has been deployed in recent
    historical contexts and policy initiatives, using examples to bring the
    theory to life.

    This Article explores the role of lawyers in democratic backsliding—the
    degradation of democratic institutions and practices using law rather than
    violence. The Article’s central aim is to set an agenda and outline an
    approach to studying the professional paradox at the center of backsliding:
    why and how lawyers attack the rule of law. It thus seeks to shift the
    scholarly lens from the conventional view of lawyers as defenders of
    democracy to investigate lawyers as authors of autocracy. Toward that end,
    the Article theorizes the legal profession as a site of backsliding,
    outlining a framework that positions lawyers in relation to distinct
    pathways of autocratization on the slow road of gradual democratic decline
    and the fast track of imminent democratic attack. On the slow road, the
    Article draws upon evidence of structural change in the American legal
    profession to suggest how the erosion of key democratic functions performed
    by lawyers increases backsliding risk by reducing trust in the legal system
    and commitment to the rule of law. On the fast track, using the 2020 Stop
    the Steal campaign as a case study, the Article shows how lawyers in moments
    of democratic crisis engage in legal mobilization to weaponize distrust,
    fusing legal and media tactics to legitimize false claims and justify
    invocation of extraordinary power. The Article concludes by calling for
    changes to U.S. professional regulation and education to strengthen
    democratic resilience, while mapping a research agenda for comparative study
    of antidemocratic lawyering in unsettled times.

    workers negatively for racist, sexist, or other illegal reasons. Absent a

  abstract: "In this provocative book, one of our most eminent political scientists poses the question, “Why should\_Americans uphold their constitution?” The vast majority of Americans venerate the Constitution and the democratic principles it embodies, but many also worry that the United States has fallen behind other nations on crucial issues, including economic equality, racial integration, and women’s rights. Robert Dahl explores this vital tension between the Americans’ belief in the legitimacy of their constitution and their belief in the principles of democracy.Dahl starts with the assumption that the legitimacy of the American Constitution derives solely from its utility as an instrument of democratic governance. Dahl demonstrates that, due to the context in which it was conceived, our constitution came to incorporate significant antidemocratic elements. Because the Framers of the Constitution had no relevant example of a democratic political system on which to model the American government, many defining aspects of our political system were implemented as a result of short-sightedness or last-minute compromise. Dahl highlights those elements of the American system that are most unusual and potentially antidemocratic: the federal system, the bicameral legislature, judicial review, presidentialism, and the electoral college system.The political system that emerged from the world’s first great democratic experiment is unique—no other well-established democracy has copied it. How does the American constitutional system function in comparison to other democratic systems? How could our political system be altered to achieve more democratic ends? To what extent did the Framers of the Constitution build features into our political system that militate against significant democratic reform?Refusing to accept the status of the American Constitution as a sacred text, Dahl challenges us all to think critically about the origins of our political system and to consider the opportunities for creating a more democratic society."

    The quality of the legal system is of fundamental importance within any
    society, but the economics of attorney discipline (AD) have not been studied
    empirically. We rank states by AD resources, complaints, and convictions,
    and explore the impact of AD on economic growth. The American Bar
    Association’s annual Survey on Lawyer Discipline (SOLD) reports complaints
    and charges regarding lawyer misconduct, the caseload per disciplinary
    attorney, and each state’s budget for attorney discipline. We develop five
    measures of attorney discipline and a composite measure. We consider low
    levels of AD to indicate less effective legal systems. Since prior
    literature finds a relation between corruption and state economic growth, we
    assess the ability of our AD variables to explain growth, finding that
    states with lower levels of AD experience slower growth. To our knowledge,
    no other study has considered the SOLD data to evaluate the quality of
    attorney discipline, or its impact on growth. One implication is that legal
    ethics training adds value to society.

    It appears to be taken for granted today that there is no future for U.S.
    labor law and that the only legitimate discussion is about what will replace
    the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA 1;29 U.S.C. 151). However, what if
    these conclusions misread the complex forces that have affected union
    membership and power? Some contend that unions and collective bargaining are
    dinosaurs that have no relevance to our times. However, consider the role of
    unionization and collective bargaining as necessary counterweights to the
    power of corporations and, thus necessary constituents of a democracy. This
    article examines the future of US labor law and the long struggle for labor
    rights.

    Although the fields of organization theory and social movement theory have
    long been viewed as belonging to different worlds, recent events have
    intervened, reminding us that organizations are becoming more movement-like
    - more volatile and politicized - while movements are more likely to borrow
    strategies from organizations. Organization theory and social movement
    theory are two of the most vibrant areas within the social sciences. This
    collection of original essays and studies both calls for a closer connection
    between these fields and demonstrates the value of this interchange. Three
    introductory, programmatic essays by leading scholars in the two fields are
    followed by eight empirical studies that directly illustrate the benefits of
    this type of cross-pollination. The studies variously examine the processes
    by which movements become organized and the role of movement processes
    within and among organizations. The topics covered range from globalization
    and transnational social movement organizations to community recycling
    programs.

    legitimate place." - Michel Wieviorka, President, International Sociological
    Association  This ISA Handbook presents and tracks the transformation of the
    societies and social relations that characterize the twenty-first century.
    The volume is organized around a conceptualization of three processes that
    are fundamental to the analyses of micro, meso and macro social relations:
    conflict, competition, and cooperation.  In addition to chapters that delve
    into sociological theory, case studies and overviews of subfields discuss
    and contextualize debates from an international perspective, incorporating
    relevant material about North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa and
    Asia.  Chapters on topics and fields crucial to the experience of people
    around the world include, among others: childhood studies, consumption,
    hunger, labour studies, peace-keeping, law, health, sport, and welfare. 
    Systematic and informed, the handbook will serve readers in all branches of
    the social sciences, providing both experienced researchers and novices with
    the materials to explore the different domains of contemporary life.

    In terms of work and workplaces there are a number of distinguishing
    features of the predictions associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution
    (4IR). The first is the change in the composition and skillsets of the
    workforce. There will not only be labor displacement, but there will also be
    a shift towards new and different jobs and toward new skillsets. The
    challenge for governments will be dealing with labor displacement and labor
    reskilling. The second change is the very nature of work and workplaces.
    There will be more work located away from designated workplaces and more
    work that involves interaction with information and communication
    technologies. The third change will be regulatory, as work will become
    “invisible” and geographically dispersed through online and subcontracting
    arrangements. For governments there will be challenges regulating
    employment, identifying employers, collecting taxes, and supporting social
    protections, such as through pensions. To illustrate the changes and
    challenges associated with 4IR, this article addresses gig work. This
    material is new to the extent that the terminology and its analysis have
    only emerged within the past five years. It captures many of the issues and
    challenges associated with 4IR, which we will highlight through an analysis
    of gig work. The article draws on evidence from the UK and Australia to
    consider implications for the 4IR.

    Constitutional law is clearly shaped by judicial actors. But who else
    contributes? Scholars in the past have recognized that the legislative
    branch plays a significant role in determining structural issues, such as
    separation of powers and federalism, but stopped there--claiming that only
    courts had the independence and expertise to safeguard individual and
    minority rights. In this readable and engaging narrative, the authors
    identify the nuts and bolts of the national dialogue and relate succinct
    examples of how elected officials and the general public often dominate the
    Supreme Court in defining the Constitution's meaning. Making use of case
    studies on race, privacy, federalism, war powers, speech, and religion,
    Devins and Fisher demonstrate how elected officials uphold individual rights
    in such areas as religious liberty and free speech as well as, and often
    better than, the courts. This fascinating debunking of judicial supremacy
    argues that nonjudicial contributions to constitutional interpretation make
    the Constitution more stable, more consistent with constitutional
    principles, and more protective of individual and minority rights.

    Are Supreme Court justices swayed by the political environment that
    surrounds them? Most people think "yes," and they point to the influence of
    the general public and the other branches of government on the Court. It is
    not that simple, however.  As the eminent law and politics scholars Neal
    Devins and Lawrence Baum show in The Company They Keep, justices today are
    reacting far more to subtle social forces in their own elite legal world
    than to pressure from the other branches of government or mass public
    opinion. In particular, the authors draw from social psychology research to
    show why Justices are apt to follow the lead of the elite social networks
    that they are a part of. The evidence is strong: Justices take cues
    primarily from the people who are closest to them and whose approval they
    care most about: political, social, and professional elites. In an era of
    strong partisan polarization, elite social networks are largely bifurcated
    by partisan and ideological loyalties, and the Justices reflect that
    division. The result is a Court in which the Justices' ideological stances
    reflect the dominant views in the appointing president's party. Justices
    such as Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg live largely in a milieu
    populated by like-minded elites. Today's partisanship on the Court also
    stems from the emergence of conservative legal networks such as the
    Federalist Society, that reinforce the conservative leanings of Republican
    appointees. For the Warren and Burger Courts, elite social networks were
    dominated by liberal elites and not divided by political party or ideology.
    A fascinating examination of the factors that shape decision-making, The
    Company They Keep will reshape our understanding of how political
    polarization occurs on the contemporary Supreme Court.

    International commercial arbitration has become big legal business, the

    be seen in high-profile disputes, such as those arising from the
    nationalizations of oil concessions in the 1970s and 1980s, huge
    international construction projects such as the tunnel under the English
    channel, and such international incidents as the French sinking of the
    *Rainbow Warrior* on its Greenpeace mission, which have increasingly been
    submitted to international panels of arbitrators. Success is also evident in
    the tremendous growth since the late 1970s in the number of arbitration

    chores. Sometime later, their tasks completed, several young women, laden
    with recently harvested produce, met in the village square to go to the
    market town, as was their custom and duty. This was not an easy trip: Yunnan
    was a poor, mountainous province with few paved roads, railways, or

    CSCW systems are playing an increasing role in activism. How can new
    communications technologies support social movements? The possibilities are
    intriguing, but as yet not fully understood. One key technique traditionally
    leveraged by social movements is storytelling. In this paper, we examine the
    use of collective storytelling online in the context of a social movement
    organization called Hollaback, an organization working to stop street
    harassment. Can sharing a story of experienced harassment really make a
    difference to an individual or a community? Using Emancipatory Action
    Research and qualitative methods, we interviewed people who contributed
    stories of harassment online. We found that sharing stories shifted
    participants' cognitive and emotional orientation towards their experience.
    The theory of "framing" from social movement research explains the
    surprising power of this experience for Hollaback participants. We
    contribute a way of looking at activism online using social movement theory.
    Our work illustrates that technology can help crowd-sourced framing
    processes that have traditionally been done by social movement
    organizations.

    Decades of work on the legal profession have confirmed that there are
    hierarchies in the profession that every lawyer knows. Access to the most
    prestigious positions has not been attained by women and minorities in
    proportion to their representation in the lawyer population. At the same
    time, however, this inequality is not consistently reflected in measures of
    job satisfaction—and it is this disjuncture of expressions of job
    satisfaction within structures of inequality that calls for a new approach
    to understanding lawyer satisfaction. We therefore seek in this article to

    Every year in Canada and the U.S., the share of higher education faculty who
    teach off the tenure track grows. One might expect that faculty unionization
    would limit this process, but the data examined here indicate that this is
    not so. While Canadian universities are significantly more unionized than
    their U.S. counterparts, they rely at least as heavily on contingent
    faculty. Similarly, U.S. states with high levels of unionization do not
    exhibit lower levels of casualization. Union strategies that
    institutionalize divisions between tenure-track and non-tenure-track, and/or
    between part-time and full-time faculty, probably play a role in this
    outcome. They can and should also play a pivotal role in reversing these
    trends if they develop the political will to do so.

    Questions about the nature of money have gained a new urgency in the
    aftermath of the global financial crisis. Even as many people have less of
    it, there are more forms and systems of money, from local currencies and
    social lending to mobile money and Bitcoin. Yet our understanding of what
    money is―and what it might be―hasn't kept pace. In The Social Life of Money,
    Nigel Dodd, one of today’s leading sociologists of money, reformulates the
    theory of the subject for a postcrisis world in which new kinds of money are
    proliferating.What counts as legitimate action by central banks that issue
    currency and set policy? What underpins the right of nongovernmental actors
    to create new currencies? And how might new forms of money surpass or
    subvert government-sanctioned currencies? To answer such questions, The
    Social Life of Money takes a fresh and wide-ranging look at modern theories
    of money.One of the book’s central concerns is how money can be wrested from
    the domination and mismanagement of banks and governments and restored to
    its fundamental position as the "claim upon society" described by Georg
    Simmel. But rather than advancing yet another critique of the state-based
    monetary system, The Social Life of Money draws out the utopian aspects of
    money and the ways in which its transformation could in turn transform
    society, politics, and economics. The book also identifies the contributions
    of thinkers who have not previously been thought of as monetary
    theorists―including Nietzsche, Benjamin, Bataille, Deleuze and Guattari,
    Baudrillard, Derrida, and Hardt and Negri. The result provides new ways of
    thinking about money that seek not only to understand it but to change it.
    Complete with a new preface that discusses recent developments in the
    evolution of money, the book draws out the ways in which its transformation
    could in turn radically alter society, politics, and economics.

    This volume presents a network of social power, indicating that theories
    inspired by C.Wright Mills are far more accurate views about power in
    America than those of Mills's opponents.Dr. Domhoff shows how and why
    coalitions within the power elite have involved themselves in such policy
    issues as the Social Security Act (1935) and the Employment Act (1946), and
    how the National Labor Relations Act (1935) could pass against the
    opposition of every major corporation. The book descri bes how experts
    worked closely with the power elite in shaping the plansfor a post-World War
    II world economic order, in good part realized during the past 30 years.
    Arguments are advanced that the fat cats who support the Democrats cannot be
    understood in terms of narrow self-interest, and that moderate conservatives
    dominated policy-making under Reagan.

    Rejecting the concept of law as subservient to social pathology, the
    principle aim of this article is to locate law as a critical matter of
    social structure – and power – which requires to be considered as a central
    element in the construction of society and social institutions. As such,
    this article contends that wider jurisprudential notions such as legal
    procedure and procedural justice, and juridical power and discretion are
    cogent, robust normative social concerns (as much as they are legal
    concerns) that positively require consideration and representation in the
    empirical study of sociological phenomena. Reflecting upon scholarship and
    research evidence on legal procedure and decision-making, the article
    attempts to elucidate the inter-relationship between power, ‘the social’,
    and the operation of law. It concludes that law is not ‘socially marginal’
    but socially, totally central.

    Since the 1980s, social movement scholars have investigated the dynamic of
    movement/countermovement interaction. Most of these studies posit movements
    as initiators, with countermovements reacting to their challenges. Yet
    sometimes a movement supports an agenda in response to a countermovement
    that engages in what we call "anticipatory countermobilization." We
    interviewed ten leading LGBT activists to explore the hypothesis that the
    LGBT movement was brought to the fight for marriage equality by the
    anticipatory countermobilization of social conservatives who opposed
    same-sex marriage before there was a realistic prospect that it would be
    recognized by the courts or political actors. Our findings reinforce the
    existing scholarship, but also go beyond it in emphasizing a triangular
    relationship among social movement organizations, countermovement
    organizations, and grassroots supporters of same-sex marriage. More broadly,
    the evidence suggests the need for a more reciprocal understanding of the
    relations among movements, countermovements, and sociolegal change.

    “Sure to become the definitive account of the fire. . . . Triangle is social
    history at its best, a magnificent portrayal not only of the catastrophe but
    also of the time and the turbulent city in which it took place.” —The New
    York Times Book ReviewTriangle is a poignantly detailed account of the 1911
    disaster that horrified the country and changed the course of
    twentieth-century politics and labor relations. On March 25, 1911, as
    workers were getting ready to leave for the day, a fire broke out in the
    Triangle Shirtwaist factory in New York’s Greenwich Village. Within minutes
    it spread to consume the building’s upper three stories. Firemen who arrived
    at the scene were unable to rescue those trapped inside: their ladders
    simply weren’t tall enough. People on the street watched in horror as
    desperate workers jumped to their deaths. The final toll was 146 people—123
    of them women. It was the worst disaster in New York City history. Triangle
    is a vibrant and immensely moving account that Bob Woodward calls, “A
    riveting history written with flare and precision.”

    This book, designed to give a survey history of American labor from colonial
    times to the present, is uniquely well suited to speak to the concerns of
    today’s teachers and students. As issues of growing inequality, stagnating
    incomes, declining unionization, and exacerbated job insecurity have
    increasingly come to define working life over the last 20 years, a new
    generation of students and teachers is beginning to seek to understand labor
    and its place and ponder seriously its future in American life. Like its
    predecessors, this ninth edition of our classic survey of American labor is
    designed to introduce readers to the subject in an engaging, accessible way.

    This paper considers the interaction of legal norms and social norms in the
    regulation of work and working relations, observing that, with the
    contraction of collective bargaining, this is a matter that no longer
    attracts the attention that it deserves. Drawing upon two concepts from
    sociology – Max Weber's ‘labour constitution’ and Seymour Martin Lipset's
    ‘occupational community’ – it focuses on possibilities for the emergence,
    within groups of workers, of shared normative beliefs concerning ‘industrial
    justice’ (Selznick); for collective solidarity and agency; for the
    transformation of shared beliefs into legally binding norms; and for the
    enforcement of those norms. If labour law is currently in ‘crisis’, then a
    promising route out of the crisis, we argue, is for the law to recover its
    procedural focus, facilitating and encouraging these processes.

    This paper revisits the notions of contract and status found in classical
    sociology, legal theory, and labour law. Adopting an historical perspective,
    it explores the fragmentation of the status of industrial citizenship during
    the neoliberal period and discusses the enduring usefulness of the
    status/contract distinction in analyzing current trends in the regulation of
    working relations, including the spread of “gig” or platform-mediated work.
    Elements of status, it is argued, must always be present if work is to be
    performed and paid for as the parties require it. Claims to the contrary –
    for example, that the gig economy creates a labour market without search
    frictions and only minimal transaction costs: contracts without status –
    assume an undersocialized model of (monadic) social action that has no

    basis in the reality of social life (Durkheim, Weber). Still, status may
    come in a variety of forms that are more or less desirable from the
    perspective of workers, businesses, and society at large. The paper traces
    what it conceives as the privatization of status via contracts between
    employers and workers

    under the pressure of marketization and dominated by corporate hierarchies.
    Towards the end of the twentieth century, sociologists observed the division
    of workers into two groups or classes – core (with relatively well-paid and
    secure employment) and peripheral (low-paid and insecure). Thirty years
    later, gross inequalities of wealth and conceptions of the neoliberal self
    as ever-improving, everperfectible, are combining to create novel forms of
    status not fully anticipated by the literature.

    Over the course of the past 40 years, neoliberalism has all but destroyed
    the institutions that once civilized labour markets. In the wake of that
    destruction, labour law reform is being driven in some jurisdictions by a
    new kind of right-wing populist politics. What does this hold in store for
    work relations? Our investigation of contemporary labour law begins with a
    brief look backwards to the pre- and post-war decades and to the ostensible
    depoliticization of the law under neoliberalism. We then consider the
    possible emergence of a distinctly right-wing populist approach to labour
    law in countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, and
    Poland, drawing comparisons with the German experience after neocorporatism.
    Finally, we take a normative turn and consider what steps ought to be taken
    by a government intent on addressing class inequalities and restoring the
    kind of rights that post-war democracies once conferred on workers
    understood to be industrial citizens.

    Anthropological research has produced a number of robust findings about
    organized labor. National and state policies are the chief determinates of
    unions' power to organize workers for concerted action to redress the
    imbalance between those who provide labor and those who control its use
    through ownership or management of capital. Unions are effective when
    workers do not accept management paradigms of shared interest; the
    organization of production promotes worker self-organization; discussion
    among workers is possible; unions show members how to address problems with
    space, ideology, and management manipulations of emotions; and unions draw
    on community contacts and social relations beyond the workplace. Unions are
    ineffective when they are corrupt, racist, and inattentive to change.
    Servicing and organizing functions of unions are contradictory. These and
    other findings leave many topics that anthropologists have not
    ethnographically explored and define an agenda for future research.

    The study focuses on changes of surnames among Czech and Moravian Jews. The
    changes are tracked until the start of the German occupation in 1939. The
    source material is comprised of Jewish birth registers from 1867 to 1918
    from Prague, as this was the most populous Jewish community of the region.
    These records are part of fund No. 167 stored in the Czech National Archive.
    More than 17,000 Jewish children were born in Prague during this period and
    only 350 of them changed their surnames. Surnames were mostly changed by
    young men under the age of 30. A large wave of renaming occurred mainly at
    the beginning of the 1920s shortly after the formation of Czechoslovakia
    (1918). Renaming was part of the assimilation process but was not connected
    to conversion to Christianity. The main goal was the effort to remove names
    perceived as ethnically stereotypical, which could stigmatize their bearers
    (e.g., Kohn, Löwy, Abeles, Taussig, Goldstein, etc.). Characteristic of the
    new surnames was the effort to preserve the same initial letter from the
    original surname. The phenomenon is compared with the situation in
    neighboring countries (Germany, Hungary, and Poland).

    Civil rights law, in particular Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act
    (Title VII), creates administrative and legal channels for redressing
    complaints regarding equal employment opportunity and affirmative action
    (EEO/AA). Employers cannot forbid employees to use these formal legal
    channels to express their EEO/AA complaints, but they can encourage
    employees to use internal complaint procedures in an attempt to satisfy
    complainants and to insulate the employer from lawsuits, liability, and
    intervention by regulatory agencies.  To the extent that employers handle
    EEO/AA complaints internally, they essentially privatize the adjudication of

The stories will make you angry and break your heart.” — American Prospect\_ \_ Jessica Compton’s family of four would have no income if she didn’t donate plasma twice a week at her local donation center in Tennessee. Modonna Harris and her teenage daughter, Brianna, in Chicago, often have no food but spoiled milk on weekends. After two decades of brilliant research on American poverty, Kathryn Edin noticed something she hadn’t seen before — households surviving on virtually no cash income. Edin teamed with Luke Shaefer, an expert on calculating incomes of the poor, to discover that the number of American families living on $2.00 per person, per day, has skyrocketed to one and a half million households, including about three million children. Where do these families live? How did they get so desperately poor?

  abstract: >-
    Our sharpest and most original social critic goes "undercover" as an
    unskilled worker to reveal the dark side of American prosperity.Millions of
    Americans work full time, year round, for poverty-level wages. In 1998,
    Barbara Ehrenreich decided to join them. She was inspired in part by the
    rhetoric surrounding welfare reform, which promised that a job -- any job --
    can be the ticket to a better life. But how does anyone survive, let alone
    prosper, on $6 an hour? To find out, Ehrenreich left her home, took the
    cheapest lodgings she could find, and accepted whatever jobs she was
    offered. Moving from Florida to Maine to Minnesota, she worked as a
    waitress, a hotel maid, a cleaning woman, a nursing-home aide, and a
    Wal-Mart sales clerk. She lived in trailer parks and crumbling residential
    motels. Very quickly, she discovered that no job is truly "unskilled," that
    even the lowliest occupations require exhausting mental and muscular effort.
    She also learned that one job is not enough; you need at least two if you
    int to live indoors.Nickel and Dimed reveals low-rent America in all its
    tenacity, anxiety, and surprising generosity -- a land of Big Boxes, fast
    food, and a thousand desperate stratagems for survival. Read it for the
    smoldering clarity of Ehrenreich's perspective and for a rare view of how
    "prosperity" looks from the bottom. You will never see anything -- from a
    motel bathroom to a restaurant meal -- in quite the same way again.

    For many years scholars have sought to explain why the European states which
    emerged in the period before the French Revolution developed along such
    different lines. Why did some states become absolutist and others
    constitutionalist? What enabled some to develop bureaucratic administrative
    systems, while others remained dependent upon patrimonial practices?This
    book presents a new theory of state-building in medieval and early modern
    Europe. Ertman argues that two factors -- local government and sustained
    geo-military competition -- can explain most of the variation found across
    the continent.

- id: Estlund2020
  abstract: >-
    The modern law of labor and employment emerged out of a century of struggle
    by workers and their organizations for recognition of the public stake in
    those relationships. That struggle supplies a historical plot line for this
    account in the US: From the publicly-enforced dominance of private law
    before the New Deal settlement in the 1930s; to the New Deal model itself,
    with collective bargaining at its core; to the subsequent rise of the public
    law of employment, centered in the courts; to the present moment. The net
    result is a body of law that in one sense is neither here nor there, but
    that contains elements of both private and public law.  The U.S. law of work
    and its history may be unusual, among other ways, in the extent to which the
    battle lines between labor and capital have corresponded to the lines
    between private and public law. A brief survey of that history will set the
    stage here for a closer look at tensions between private and public law
    within contemporary employment law, especially as seen in controversies over
    mandatory arbitration and independent contracting. Both controversies
    illustrate employer efforts to expand the domain of private ordering through
    contract and to blunt or escape the liabilities and limitations arising out
    of public employment law. The story is largely U.S.-centric, but will offer
    some broader comparative observations along the way and in concluding.

    Why do some people not hesitate to call the police to quiet a barking dog in
    the middle of the night, while others accept the pain and losses associated
    with defective products, unsuccesful surgery, and discrimination? Patricia
    Ewick and Susan Silbey collected accounts of the law from more than four
    hundred people of diverse backgrounds in order to explore the different ways
    that people use and experience it. Their fascinating and original study
    identifies three common narratives of law that are captured in the stories
    people tell. One narrative is based on an idea of the law as magisterial and
    remote. Another views the law as a game with rules that can be manipulated
    to one’s advantage. A third narrative describes the law as an arbitrary
    power that is actively resisted. Drawing on these extensive case studies,
    Ewick and Silbey present individual experiences interwoven with an analysis
    that charts a coherent and compelling theory of legality. A groundbreaking
    study of law and narrative, The Common Place of Law depicts the institution
    as it is lived: strange and familiar, imperfect and ordinary, and at the
    center of daily life.

    This book sheds new light on how jurors interpret justice in the wake of
    accidents and reveals much about the psychology of jury decision making in
    general. Using case material, the author analyzed both the words lawyers use
    to help jurors assign blame and the words jurors themselves use as they make
    decisions. The author discusses the relevant social and cognitive literature
    and shows how jurors' everyday habits of thought and feeling inform their
    deliberations. The author's thesis is that jurors use legal facts and rules
    in combination with common sense to process what he calls total justice.
    Contrary to stereotypes about jurors, both emotion and reason appear to be
    central to reaching a decision that feels right to the jury. This book is
    for forensic psychologists, practicing students, lawyers, and anyone
    interested in learning about the psychology of legal persuasion. (PsycINFO

    Labor Guide to Labor Law is a comprehensive survey of labor law in the
    private sector, written from the labor perspective for labor relations
    students and for unions and their members. This thoroughly revised and
    updated fifth edition covers new statutes, current issues, and the latest
    developments in labor and employment law.The text emphasizes issues of
    greatest importance to unions and employees. Where the law permits a union
    to make certain tactical choices, those choices are pointed out. Material is
    included on internal union matters that tend to be ignored in management
    texts. Bruce S. Feldacker and Michael J. Hayes cover applicable labor law
    principles from a union's initial organizing campaign to the mature
    bargaining relationship, including such subjects as the employee right to
    engage in protected concerted activity, the duty to bargain, labor
    arbitration, the use of strikes, picketing and other economic weapons in
    resolving a labor dispute, the duty of fair representation, internal union
    regulation, and employment discrimination.This book is also a useful
    reference and review for full-time union officers and representatives who
    have a working knowledge of labor law but wish to brush up on certain points
    as needed in their work. Both authors have extensive experience in the
    construction field, and they have been careful to include material on those
    aspects of labor law that are unique to that field.Labor Guide to Labor Law
    is structured to present an unbiased and comprehensive explanation of labor
    law principles for anyone interested in the field. Thus, labor relations
    educators, as well as practitioners in the field representing labor,
    management, or individual employees, should also find the text suitable for
    their use. Each chapter includes a summary, review questions and answers, a
    restatement of "Basic Legal principles" with citations to key cases, and a
    bibliography for additional research.

    There is a growing movement to create successful, ethical, well-rounded and
    practice ready legal professionals both in terms of their content knowledge
    and their mental well-being. As a Legal Teaching “profession” it is
    incumbent on us to answer this call in a responsive, creative, integrated,
    well researched and evaluated manner. This paper provides a suggested and
    evaluated framework for how this call can be met without resorting to “add
    on” subjects (no matter how well-intentioned), that stand outside the
    “normal” law school curriculum. Instead of partitioning well-being and
    professionalism into separate silos, it is suggested that all efforts must
    be made to integrate the seeds, thoughts, and actions of ethics, well-being,
    and professionalism into as many aspects of each of our programs as
    possible.

    As an organizing concept, whiteness rests on insecure theoretical
    ground—specifically, the notions of identity and agency. It replaces racism
    with race and equates race with racial identity, which it accepts
    uncritically both as an empirical datum and as a tool of analysis. It
    thereby establishes a false parallel between the objects and the authors of
    racism and between Afro-Americans and other Americans of non-European
    ancestry. Whiteness is the ideological counterpart of race relations, both
    of them ways of skirting around the relations of political, social, and
    economic power that have determined the place of Afro-Americans in American
    society.

    The old norms of the 9-to-5, 40-h workweek developed in the twentieth
    century have eroded. They have been replaced with unpredictable schedules
    where the number and timing of work hours can vary day-to-day.
    #SchedulesThatWork is a rallying cry for workers responding to this new
    flexibility. The chapter considers a new crusade for the nation’s retail
    labor force, fueled by labor-worker–community coalitions such as the Retail
    Action Project. Led by New York State, several state attorneys general have
    sought to apply labor laws to curtail these employment practices. In a
    victory for their largely part-time workforce, some major retailers such as
    Starbucks, The Gap, Macys, and Zara have ended their “on-call” shifts and
    are posting schedules with more advance notice.

    This story opens in Immokalee, Florida, the fresh tomato capital of the USA.
    It is about one aspect of social practices in food production: the movement
    to increase the pay of farmworkers in the supply chain of the American
    tomato. In a new model of worker organizing, the Coalition of Immokalee
    Workers (CIW) realized growers were themselves squeezed by large fast food
    companies and supermarkets. So the Coalition went directly to food giants
    through their “penny a pound” movement, demanding that companies sign a Fair
    Food Agreement with a human rights code of conduct and independent
    monitoring. Today, coast to coast, at many fast food restaurants in the USA,
    you are eating a fair food tomato. And tomato pickers are earning more per
    week.

    Colors Restaurant & Bar in New York City has made a name for itself by
    serving as a role model for the equitable treatment of workers in the
    traditionally low-paid restaurant industry. As described in this chapter,
    this cooperative enterprise also illustrates that businesses can operate
    with multiple motivations beyond profit maximization. Colors Restaurant is
    an unanticipated byproduct of Restaurant Opportunities Centers-United
    (ROC-U), a membership organization initially formed by restaurant workers
    displaced from jobs in the World Trade Center after 9/11. ROC-U operates
    Colors as part-restaurant, part-training facility, and part-exemplar of
    “high road” employment practices. ROC-U’s other campaigns (such as “One Fair
    Wage”) and litigation have secured pledges for better wages and working
    conditions from some larger restaurant conglomerates in the United States.

    The path to marriage equality in the USA progressed—like previous civil
    rights moments—over decades, sometimes in waves but at other times with
    backlash. The movement for marriage equality (the redefinition of the
    institution of marriage) can be viewed as a rejection of invidious
    distinctions between the romantic unions of straight couples and gay
    couples. This story spotlights four moments in legal history culminating
    with the Obergefell v. Hodges Supreme Court decision on June 26, 2015,
    legalizing marriage equality nationwide. These legal strategies worked in
    tandem with state legislation as well as other forms of activism. The
    analysis shows that courts do not operate in a vacuum. They are both
    influenced by and influence society and its changing values, with iterative
    feedback effects.

    Culture is a concept that, like mushrooms on a dewy summer morning, is now
    discovered everywhere. Suddenly it has emerged through the sociological
    underbrush, a reality to which this volume’s theme pays heed. Social
    movements are, in several senses, cultural movements, underpinned by
    discursive practices.  The concept of culture is admittedly broad, useful
    both for macro- and microanalyses of social movements. From a “macro”
    perspective on culture, sociologists recognize that a social movement is not
    only politically and socially situated, but culturally situated as well
    (Eder 1982; Horowitz 1977; Marx and Holzner 1975). The proposals, tactics,
    and organization of a

    Two views prevail concerning Karl Marx’s alleged antisemitism. The
    disparaging view is that Marx, notwithstanding his Jewish origins, was
    himself an antisemite *avant la lettre* or at least made use of antisemitic
    tropes and reproduced antisemitic stereotypes in his own work. This view is
    present among some commentators on Marx and firmly entrenched among students
    of modern antisemitism.¹ It is based in particular on a reading of the
    second of Marx’s two 1843 essays, “On the Jewish Question,” where he appears
    to link Judaism to huckstering and global financial power and to equate
    human emancipation with emancipation of society from

    America's economic revolution isn't just driven by technology. It's about
    markets.The past twenty-five years have witnessed a remarkable shift in how
    we get the stuff we want. If you've ever owned a business, rented an
    apartment, or shopped online, you've had a front-row seat for this
    revolution-in-progress. Breakthrough companies like Amazon and Uber have
    disrupted the old ways and made the economy work better—all thanks to
    technology.At least that's how the story of the modern economy is usually
    told. But in this lucid, wry book, Ray Fisman and Tim Sullivan show that the
    revolution is bigger than tech: it is really a story about the
    transformation of markets. From the auction theories that power Google's ad
    sales algorithms to the models that online retailers use to prevent internet
    fraud, even the most high-tech modern businesses are empowered by theory
    first envisioned by economists.And we're all participants in this
    revolution. Every time you book a room on Airbnb, hire a car on Lyft, or
    click on an ad, you too are reshaping our social institutions and our
    lives.The Inner Lives of Markets is necessary reading for the modern world:
    it reveals the blueprint for how we work, live, and shop, and offers wisdom
    for how to do it better.

  abstract: >-
    The post-World War II years in the United States were marked by the business
    community's efforts to discredit New Deal liberalism and undermine the power
    and legitimacy of organized labor. In Selling Free Enterprise, Elizabeth
    Fones-Wolf describes how conservative business leaders strove to reorient
    workers away from their loyalties to organized labor and government,
    teaching that prosperity could be achieved through reliance on individual
    initiative, increased productivity, and the protection of personal liberty.
    Based on research in a wide variety of business and labor sources, this
    detailed account shows how business permeated every aspect of American life,
    including factories, schools, churches, and community institutions.

  abstract: >-
    Why did American workers, unlike their European counterparts, fail to forge
    a class-based movement to pursue broad social reform? Was it simply that
    they lacked class consciousness and were more interested in personal
    mobility? In a richly detailed survey of labor law and labor history,
    William Forbath challenges this notion of American “individualism.” In fact,
    he argues, the nineteenth-century American labor movement was much like
    Europe’s labor movements in its social and political outlook, but in the
    decades around the turn of the century, the prevailing attitude of American
    trade unionists changed. Forbath shows that, over time, struggles with the
    courts and the legal order were crucial to reshaping labor’s outlook,
    driving the labor movement to temper its radical goals.

    2020 brought many challenges, which included administering the bar exam. 
    States jumped through numerous obstacles to continue administering the
    current form of the exam.  However, the current bar exam has never been
    proven to be a valid measure of attorney competence.  This article offers
    evidence the Multistate Bar Exam (MBE), is invalid. The exam, in other
    words, does not measure the knowledge and skills that lawyers use in
    practice. On the contrary, it is an artificial barrier to practice—one that
    harms the public by failing to screen for the knowledge and skills that
    clients need from their attorneys.

    Praise for the first edition:"This very valuable book reports the results of
    a large-scale and complex survey aimed at understanding the preferences of
    employees regarding workplace governance and their attitudes toward the
    three key institutions in the labor market: unions, government, and
    firms.... The findings are... sophisticated and convincing.... This is a
    terrifically useful book that contains a wealth of information."―Labor
    History "What Workers Want is one of the most ambitious efforts ever
    undertaken to determine the attitudes of employees about the American
    workplace.... An extremely important contribution to the long and often
    heated debates that swirl around these issues."―Ralph Nader, Public Citizen
    News"What Workers Want is a sharply focused study of how American workers
    think about workplace participation. This book is a message about workplace
    democracy that union leaders would do well to build into their organizing
    strategies."―Dissent "This is easily one of the most readable books on
    industrial relations matters written by academics in recent times. The
    authors are able simultaneously to engage the reader in an almost folksy
    manner, while also being quite rigorous in their presentation of data. There
    should be more such books."―The Journal of Industrial Relations How would a
    typical American workplace be structured if the employees could design it?
    According to Richard B. Freeman and Joel Rogers, it would be an organization
    run jointly by employees and their supervisors, one where disputes between
    labor and management would be resolved through independent arbitration.
    Their groundbreaking book provides a comprehensive account of employees'
    attitudes about participation, representation, and regulation on the job.
    For this edition, the authors have added an introduction showing how recent
    data have confirmed and strengthened their basic argument. A new concluding
    chapter lays out the model of "open source unionism" that they propose for
    rebuilding unionism in the United States, making this updated edition
    essential for anyone thinking about what labor should be doing to move
    forward.

    How the history of technological revolutions can help us better understand
    economic and political polarization in the age of automation From the
    Industrial Revolution to the age of artificial intelligence, The Technology
    Trap takes a sweeping look at the history of technological progress and how
    it has radically shifted the distribution of economic and political power
    among society’s members. As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the Industrial
    Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity over the long run,
    but the immediate consequences of mechanization were devastating for large
    swaths of the population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the
    labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic inequality
    skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly mirror those in our
    current age of automation, which began with the Computer Revolution.Just as
    the Industrial Revolution eventually brought about extraordinary benefits
    for society, artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the
    same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is managed. In
    the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed their concerns over
    machines taking their jobs. The Luddite uprisings joined a long wave of
    machinery riots that swept across Europe and China. Today’s despairing
    middle class has not resorted to physical force, but their frustration has
    led to rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As
    middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there’s no assurance that
    positive attitudes to technology will persist.The Industrial Revolution was
    a defining moment in history, but few grasped its enormous consequences at
    the time. The Technology Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another
    technological revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more
    effectively face the present.

    What categories do prosecutors use to assess sexual assault cases? What are

    How do race, class, and gender become salient in prosecutors’ decisions? In
    this article I attempt to answer these questions by analyzing ethnographic
    data about prosecutors’ work in a sexual assault unit.  Previous research
    has demonstrated how descriptive practices have been used in legal
    processing. Person descriptions have been used to constitute moral character
    for purposes of negotiating plea bargains; to determine an organizationally
    relevant response to a juvenile’s behavior; and to assess the credibility of

  abstract: >-
    Using the racial integration of national labor unions as a case study, I
    find that courts played an important and meaningfully autonomous role in
    integrating unions while elected officials largely failed to act. Courts,
    unlike elected officials, offered civil rights groups relatively easy access
    to the legal agenda. In response to thousands of cases in federal courts,
    judges rewrote key civil rights statutes, oversaw the implementation of
    their rulings, and used attorneys' fees and damage awards to impose
    significant financial costs on resistant unions. Court power was the product
    of multiple and historically contingent forces that involved the interaction
    of elected officials, civil rights activists, and the legal community.
    Elected officials delegated to the courts the power to enforce civil rights
    laws and tacitly endorsed procedural changes that augmented the courts'
    institutional powers and the legal community's professional influence. In
    response, judges and lawyers promoted and implemented a civil rights agenda
    far beyond the endorsement of elected officials. An historical-institutional
    approach helps explain how courts achieved and wielded independent power and
    the consequences of their action for civil rights, labor unions, and the
    American state.

  abstract: "John Kenneth Galbraith's classic investigation of private wealth and public poverty in postwar America\_With customary clarity, eloquence, and humor, Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith gets at the heart of what economic security means in The Affluent Society. Warning against individual and societal complacence about economic inequity, he offers an economic model for investing in public wealth that challenges “conventional wisdom” (a phrase he coined that has since entered our vernacular) about the long-term value of a production-based economy and the true nature of poverty. Both politically divisive and remarkably prescient, The Affluent Society is as relevant today on the question of wealth in America as it was in 1958."

    Movement activists are media junkies. “Advocates of causes,” Edelman reminds
    us, “are an avid audience for the political spectacle” (1988: 6). Along with
    other political actors, they eagerly monitor public discourse, using it
    along with other resources to construct meaning on issues they care about.
    Media discourse provides them with “weekly, daily, sometimes hourly triumphs
    and defeats, grounds for hope and for fear, a potpourri of happenings that
    mark trends and aberrations, some of them historic.”  The more sophisticated
    among them recognize that many in their constituency—the potential
    challengers whom they would like to reach—are different from them.

    This article attempts to gain a better understanding of the sociology(ies)
    of law in a comparative perspective through a structural and comparative
    explanation of the American and the French legal fields. It is argued that
    comparative sociology of law will not be able to explain the difference
    among countries, scholars, movements, and schools of thought in short, it
    will not be able to compare—as long as it avoids the analysis of some social
    and cultural presuppositions related to the context in which these
    differences take place. It focuses mainly on two of these presuppositions.
    First, legal fields, with their history, their internal structure, and their
    power relations, and second the type of relation between the legal field and
    the state. The empirical examination provided in this article explicitly
    seeks to offer insights for the reconstruction of Bourdieu's structural
    theory of the legal field.

  abstract: >-
    Undocumented and authorized immigrant laborers, female workers, workers of
    color, guest workers, and unionized workers together compose an enormous and
    diverse part of the labor force in America. Labor and employment laws are
    supposed to protect employees from various workplace threats, such as poor
    wages, bad working conditions, and unfair dismissal. Yet as members of
    individual groups with minority status, the rights of many of these
    individuals are often dictated by other types of law, such as constitutional
    and immigration laws. Worse still, the groups who fall into these cracks in
    the legal system often do not have the political power necessary to change
    the laws for better protection.In Marginal Workers, Ruben J. Garcia
    demonstrates that when it comes to these marginal workers, the sum of the
    law is less than its parts, and, despite what appears to be a plethora of
    applicable statutes, marginal workers are frequently lacking in protection.
    To ameliorate the status of marginal workers, he argues for a new paradigm
    in worker protection, one based on human freedom and rights.

    “At-will” employment is sometimes shorthanded as employers’ rights to fire
    employees (and employees’ right to quit) for a bad or arbitrary reason, or
    for no reason at all. [togglable text="expand abstract"] Among the bad or
    arbitrary reasons that employers sometimes fire workers: something the
    worker said, or something they didn’t say. Employees have been fired, often
    without legal recourse, for criticizing their companies on social media, for
    running for office, or even for having a bumper sticker supporting a
    political candidate whose election the boss opposes. The freedom of speech
    that so many Americans valorize is in practical effect illusory for many
    American workers.


    This report traces the legal rules governing freedom of speech at work.
    Following a summary that emphasizes the scope of the problem and gives
    examples, it begins by discussing the background rules of at-will
    employment, which establish that employers may generally terminate workers
    for what they say. This rule has its limits---for example, employers may not
    fire workers in contravention of a state’s explicit public policy---but
    judges tend to apply these exceptions in a patchy and inconsistent fashion.
    Further, because the First Amendment does not constrain private actors,
    private-sector workers cannot fall back on the constitution at all; even
    public-sector employers are often free to fire or discipline workers for
    their speech.


    Beyond common law rules, the report also discusses federal, state, and local
    statutes that protect certain types of employee speech. These laws tend to
    apply only to specific subjects and manners of expression. For example, the
    National Labor Relations Act protects employees’ conversations about their
    working conditions---but only as long as those conversations occur at the
    right time, in the right place, and in the right manner. For example, among
    other limits, the NLRA protects only those conversations or meetings that
    occur during “nonwork time,” and the Trump NLRB has recently held that the
    NLRA does not protect employees’ use of their work-issued email addresses.
    Likewise, some states and localities forbid employers from retaliating
    against employees for their political views. But each of those laws has
    serious limitations in coverage, enforcement, or both. Worse, employers
    sometimes challenge even limited protections for workers’ expression on the
    grounds that those protections violate the employer’s own rights under the
    First Amendment.


    Finally, some workers have meaningful contractual protections that curb the
    effects of the at-will doctrine, including as it applies to their speech and
    expression. But workers cannot achieve these protections without either
    individual or collective power, both of which have eroded for many workers
    over the last 80 years. The result is that one real source of protection for
    workers who speak out---collective bargaining agreements in which employers

    out of reach, especially for private-sector workers.


    This&nbsp;report aims to help readers understand the legal landscape that
    effectuates the&nbsp;“freedom of speech” at&nbsp;work. It shows how
    employers have come to monopolize&nbsp;that freedom for themselves, and why
    workers&nbsp;experience speech control instead&nbsp;of speech freedom.

    The 1960s, in retrospect, were a good time for an alliance between law and
    social science both because of what was happening in the production of
    knowledge and what was happening in the streets and in the civil rights
    movement “outside” of the academy. Social science provided a new
    professionalizing expertise that offered ways to manage the new social
    agenda. Sociological knowledge thus gained in value as a new generation
    helped to define a political agenda of concern with urbanization, race
    relations, poverty, and crime. This social science learning could be used to
    challenge the postwar complacency of law schools

    From reviews of the first edition: "Brilliant, provocative . . . a great
    book."—New Statesman "An important book . . . It is a new starting line from
    which all subsequent discussions of nationalism will have to begin."—New
    Society "A better explanation than anyone has yet offered of why nationalism
    is such a prominent principle of political legitimacy today. This is a terse
    and forceful work . . . the product of great intellectual energy and an
    impressive range of knowledge."—Times Literary Supplement "Periodically, an
    important book emerges that makes us, through the uniqueness of its theory,
    perceive history as we have not seen it before. Ernest Gellner has written
    such a volume. Students of nationalism will have to come to grips with his
    interpretation of the causes for the emergence of nationalism, since he has
    declared that most of the previous explanations are largely
    mythical."—American Historical Review First published in 1983, Nations and
    Nationalism remains one of the most influential explanations of the
    emergence of nationalism ever written. This updated edition of Ernest
    Gellner's now-canonical work includes a new introductory essay from John
    Breuilly, tracing the way the field has evolved over the past two decades,
    and a bibliography of important work on nationalism since 1983.

  abstract: >-
    Is labor’s day over or is labor the only real answer for our time? National
    Book Critics Circle Award finalist and labor lawyer Thomas Geoghegan argues
    that even as organized labor seems to be crumbling, a revived—but
    different—labor movement is the only way to stabilize the economy and save
    the middle class. The inequality reshaping the country goes beyond money and
    income: the places we work have ever more rigid hierarchies. A “perceptive,
    informed, and witty utopian thinker” (Michael Kazin, Bookforum), Geoghegan
    makes his argument for labor with stories, sometimes humorous but more often
    chilling, about the problems working people like his own clients—from
    cabdrivers to schoolteachers—face, increasingly powerless in our union-free
    economy. He explains why a new kind of labor movement (and not just more
    higher education) is the real program the Democrats should push. Written “in
    the disarming style of a self-deprecating lawyer in a beleaguered field”
    (Kim Phillips-Fein, The Atlantic), Only One Thing Can Save Us is vintage
    Geoghegan, bearing unparalleled insights into the real dynamics—and human
    experience—of working in America today.

    The labor movement is weak and divided. Some think that it is dying. But
    Julius Getman, a preeminent labor scholar, demonstrates through examination
    of recent developments that a resurgent labor movement is possible. He
    proposes new models for organizing and innovating techniques to strengthen
    the strike weapon. Above all, he insists that unions must return to their
    historical roots as a social movement.

- id: getmanSupremeCourtUnions2016
  abstract: >-
    Labor unions and courts have rarely been allies. From their earliest efforts
    to organize, unions have been confronted with hostile judges and antiunion
    doctrines. In this book, Julius G. Getman argues that while the role of the
    Supreme Court has become more central in shaping labor law, its opinions
    betray a profound ignorance of labor relations along with a persisting bias
    against unions. In The Supreme Court on Unions, Getman critically examines
    the decisions of the nation's highest court in those areas that are crucial
    to unions and the workers they represent: organizing, bargaining, strikes,
    and dispute resolution.As he discusses Supreme Court decisions dealing with
    unions and labor in a variety of different areas, Getman offers an
    interesting historical perspective to illuminate the ways in which the Court
    has been an influence in the failures of the labor movement. During more
    than sixty years that have seen the Supreme Court take a dominant role, both
    unions and the institution of collective bargaining have been substantially
    weakened. While it is difficult to measure the extent of the Court’s
    responsibility for the current weak state of organized labor and many other
    factors have, of course, contributed, it seems clear to Getman that the
    Supreme Court has played an important role in transforming the law and
    defeating policies that support the labor movement.

  type: book

- id: Giddens1987
  abstract: "The social sciences have long been based upon contrasts drawn between the 'militaristic' societies of the past, and the 'capitalist' or 'industrial' societies of the present. But how valid are such contrasts, given that the current era is one stamped by the impact of war and by the intensive development of sophisticated weaponry? \_In setting out to address this and similar questions, this book investigates issues that have been substantially neglected by those working in sociology and social theory. Anthony Giddens offers a sociological analysis of the nature of the modern nation-state and its association with the means of waging war. His analysis is connected in a detailed way to problems that have traditionally preoccupied sociologists - the impact of capitalism and industrialism upon social development in the modern period. The result is a theory both of the institutional parameters of modernity and of the nature of international relations. The book is a sequel to the author's much discussed Contemporary Critique of Historical Materialism. The framework of social theory outlined in that work is here elucidated in a systematic and thorough-going fashion. The novel and provocative ideas which the author develops will interest those working in a wide variety of disciplines: sociology, politics, geography and international affairs."

  abstract: >-
    This paper adopts a historical/new institutionalist perspective to explain
    why the decline of the American labor movement has been exceptional in
    comparison to other labor movements, and especially its Canadian
    counterpart. Under this perspective, national founding conditions and
    traditions become embedded in institutional norms that shape national
    institutional environments and trajectories, substantially constraining
    labor movements and hence accounting for their development and future. The
    author argues that the founding conditions of the United States gave rise to
    "mobilization biases"-biases affecting the various parties' relative ability
    to mobilize resources, and thus ultimately privileging some interests over
    others-that explain both why the labor movement developed as it did and why
    it has declined. He concludes that, in view of these biases and the norms
    underpinning them, the American labor movement's future (unlike the future
    of its European counterparts) lies in perpetual struggle rather than the
    pursuit of a long-term accord.

    This study traces the development of union loyalties among community college
    professors. Assuming that activism is motivated by contextual and
    ideological factors, the paper analyzes the ways that social networks,
    collegiate workplaces, and framing practices transform political bystanders
    into committed union members. Using data from a study of junior college
    professors in Kentucky (N = 329), the study finds that union participation
    is strongly linked to a distrust of campus administrators and having
    pro-union friends and colleagues. Likewise, perceptions of union efficacy, a
    liberal identity as well the professor’s education level predicted the
    actual joining of their campus’ faculty union.

    This chapter deals with two broad topics. One is the “legal profession,” the
    formal institutions and organizations through which associations of lawyers
    seek and exercise state authority to regulate training for and admission to
    their guilds, to enforce their rules against members, and to protect their
    privileges against outsiders. The other and much broader topic is that of
    lawyers themselves, the people and occupational groups who make up to the
    profession, their work and social roles and their social standing, economic
    condition, and political influence. In the United States all lawyers have
    since the Revolution formally belonged to a single, unified profession,
    licensed by the states where they practice. There are no official ranks or
    specialties of lawyers, such as the English distinction between barristers
    (trial lawyers) and solicitors; the French among avocats, avoués, conseils
    juridiques, and notaires; or the German between the private profession of
    advocate and the public professions of civil servant, prosecutor, and judge,
    each calling for a different training, examination and career path. But in
    reality the legal profession is many, not one: a collection of occupational
    groups that work at very diverse practice tasks, enjoy very different levels
    of status and income, and play very different roles in the economy,
    politics, and society.

    One of the more enduring assumptions about how law works (or should work) in
    society—held by many social scientists and citizens alike—is that legal
    rules announced from a “high level” (i.e., executive officials,
    legislatures, and courts) are thereafter simply invoked by a group of
    officials at a “lower level” in order to arrest, prohibit, or compel some
    sort of action. Of course, a significant body of work in the social sciences
    demonstrates that lawmakers’, administrators’, and citizens’ aspiration for
    the rules to dictate enforcement action is seldom fulfilled. The reasons
    given for this vary.  Some argue that extralegal

    After lawsuits challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election
    failed spectacularly, some wondered whether the plaintiffs’ lawyers would be
    disciplined for filing frivolous complaints. Time will tell. But, if these
    lawyers are not disciplined, one should not be surprised. This Article
    presents an empirical study of the New York disciplinary process, which
    confirms that advocates who violate disciplinary rules by overzealously
    pursuing their clients’ interests, such as by making frivolous claims, are
    rarely punished in the disciplinary process. That is because disciplinary
    prosecutors, operating in secret, have discretion as to whether to bring
    formal charges against lawyers who violate the rules. They ordinarily
    exercise that discretion by weeding out cases involving advocacy misconduct
    that they regard as minor or that they believe to be better addressed by
    trial courts.

    Employing the allegedly frivolous election challenges as an illustration,
    this Article argues that disciplinary charging discretion raises four
    questions that the legal profession and the public should give greater
    consideration: whether rule drafters should remove rarely-enforced advocacy
    rules from the disciplinary codes; whether disciplinary agencies are
    under-enforcing advocacy rules; whether disciplinary authorities are
    arbitrary or unprincipled in selecting whom to prosecute for advocacy
    misconduct; and whether disciplinary authorities should be more transparent
    about how they make charging decisions so that the public can better
    understand whether advocacy rules, and authorities’ exercise of discretion
    in enforcing them, serve the public interest.

    Abstract: Scholarship on the history of Jews in the early modern period,
    especially European Jewry, has flourished in recent years, clearly
    demonstrating that the period from c.1500 to c.1750 should be seen as
    distinct from both medieval and modern Jewish history. Mobility of people
    and information, changing relationships among rabbinic leaders and communal
    organizations, and the evolving nature of Jewish identity are among the
    characteristics that have been noted as unique to this period. This article
    surveys how historical scholarship related to Bohemian Jewry fits in that
    context, and suggests directions for moving that scholarship forward.
    Today’s historiography has grown from foundations laid in the late
    nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Wissenschaft des Judentums
    framework, by way of the establishment of the Jewish Museum in Prague and
    scholarly activities undertaken there, through the difficult years of World
    War II and Communist rule. Building on that tradition, the strengths of
    current historical writing on early modern Bohemian Jewry include material
    and print culture. Room remains for the development of broader, more
    synthetic analyses that link this regional history more closely with its
    central European and Jewish early modern surroundings. More research on
    specific areas such as Bohemian Jewish history through the lens of gender
    analysis, wide-ranging social history, and more, together with improved
    integration with broader historiographical trends, would both shed light on
    historical processes in the Bohemian Lands and improve understanding of
    early modern Jewish history as a whole.

    On May 4, 1886, a bomb exploded at a Chicago labor rally, wounding dozens of
    policemen, seven of whom eventually died. A wave of mass hysteria swept the
    country, leading to a sensational trial, that culminated in four
    controversial executions, and dealt a blow to the labor movement from which
    it would take decades to recover. Historian James Green recounts the rise of
    the first great labor movement in the wake of the Civil War and brings to
    life an epic twenty-year struggle for the eight-hour workday. Blending a
    gripping narrative, outsized characters and a panoramic portrait of a major
    social movement, Death in the Haymarket is an important addition to the
    history of American capitalism and a moving story about the class tensions
    at the heart of Gilded Age America.

    From before the dawn of the 20th century until the arrival of the New Deal,
    one of the most protracted and deadly labor struggles in American history
    was waged in West Virginia. On one side were powerful corporations whose
    millions bought armed guards and political influence. On the other side were
    50,000 mine workers, the nation’s largest labor union, and the legendary
    “miners’ angel,” Mother Jones. The fight for unionization and civil rights
    sparked a political crisis verging on civil war that stretched from the
    creeks and hollows to the courts and the US Senate. In The Devil is Here in
    These Hills, celebrated labor historian James Green tells the story of West
    Virginia and coal like never before.The value of West Virginia’s coalfields
    had been known for decades, and after rail arrived in the 1870s,
    industrialists pushed fast into the wilderness, digging mines and building
    company towns where they wielded nearly complete control over everyday life.
    The state’s high-quality coal drove American expansion and
    industrialization, but for tens of thousands of laborers, including boys as
    young as ten, mining life showed the bitter irony of the state motto,
    “Mountaineers are Always Free.” Attempts to unionize were met with stiff
    resistance. Fundamental rights were bent, then broken, and the violence
    evolved from bloody skirmishes to open armed conflict, as an army of miners
    marched to an explosive showdown. Extensively researched and told in vibrant
    detail, The Devil is Here in These Hills is the definitive book on an
    essential chapter in the history of American freedom.

    Nationalism is a movement and a state of mind that brings together national
    identity, consciousness, and collectivities. It accomplished the great
    transformation from the old order to modernity; it placed imagination above
    production, distribution, and exchange; and it altered the nature of power
    over people and territories that shapes and directs the social and political
    world. A five-country study that spans five hundred years, this historically
    oriented work in sociology bids well to replace all previous works on the
    subject. The theme, simple yet complex, suggests that England was the
    front-runner, with its earliest sense of self-conscious nationalism and its
    pragmatic ways; it utilized existing institutions while transforming itself.
    The Americans followed, with no formed institutions to impede them. France,
    Germany, and Russia took the same, now marked, path, modifying nationalism
    in the process. Nationalism is based on empirical data in four
    languages--legal documents; period dictionaries; memoirs; correspondence;
    literary works; theological, political, and philosophical writings;
    biographies; statistics; and histories. Nowhere else is the complex
    interaction of structural, cultural, and psychological factors so thoroughly
    explained. Nowhere else are concepts like identity, anomie, and elites
    brought so refreshingly to life.

  abstract: >-
    From the longtime New York Times labor correspondent, an in-depth look at
    working men and women in America, the challenges they face, and how they can
    be re-empoweredIn an era when corporate profits have soared while wages have
    flatlined, millions of Americans are searching for ways to improve their
    lives, and they're often turning to labor unions and worker action, whether
    #RedforEd teachers' strikes or the Fight for $15. Wage stagnation, low-wage
    work, and blighted blue-collar communities have become an all-too-common
    part of modern-day America, and behind these trends is a little-discussed
    problem: the decades-long decline in worker power. Steven Greenhouse sees
    this decline reflected in some of the most pressing problems facing our
    nation today, including income inequality, declining social mobility, the
    gender pay gap, and the concentration of political power in the hands of the
    wealthy. He rebuts the often-stated view that labor unions are outmoded--or
    even harmful--by recounting some of labor's victories, and the efforts of
    several of today's most innovative and successful worker groups. He shows us
    the modern labor landscape through the stories of dozens of American
    workers, from G.M. workers to Uber drivers, and we see how unions
    historically have empowered--and lifted--the most marginalized, including
    young women garment workers in New York in 1909, black sanitation workers in
    Memphis in 1968, and hotel housekeepers today. Greenhouse proposes concrete,
    feasible ways in which workers' collective power can be--and is
    being--rekindled and reimagined in the twenty-first century.

    The concept of workers' rights as human rights has only recently begun to
    influence the formation and implementation of labor policy in the United
    States. In the workplace, the growing human rights movement challenges
    long-held beliefs and practices in labor relations. The author explores this
    issue and its implications for U.S. labor policy and practice, focusing
    specifically on individual versus collective rights, exclusive
    representation, coverage of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA),
    employer resistance to workers' freedom of association, the right to strike,
    the statutory purposes of the NLRA, and the underpinnings of the traditional
    U.S. industrial relations system. These challenges also affect U.S. legal
    isolationism, the role of labor unions, the status and implementation of
    economic as well as civil and political rights, and the U.S. labor and
    employment relations research agenda.

    According to accepted wisdom, rational practices and ritual action are

    this view. Comparative, historical, and contemporary, the six ethnographies
    extend from Macedonia to Kyrgyzstan. Each one illuminates the economic and
    ritual changes in an area as it emerged from socialism and (re-)entered
    market society. Cutting against the idea that economy only means markets and
    that market action exhausts the meaning of economy, the studies show that
    much of what is critical for a people's economic life takes place outside
    markets and hinges on ritual, understood as the negation of the everyday
    world of economising.

    Around the world, lawyers often play important roles in formulating and
    advancing social or political causes. “Cause lawyering” refers to the legal
    and extralegal engagements of politically motivated lawyers, whether the
    cause is comprehensive transformation, such as independence or
    democratization, or a more limited aspect of public policy, such as expanded
    rights or guaranteed protections of some kind. In contrast to “conventional”
    or “client lawyering,” which is tailored to accommodate prevailing
    arrangements of power, cause lawyering involves the application of
    professional skills and services to transform some aspect of the status
    quo.  The very notion of “cause” implies agency, motivation,

    This article examines the reasons why the Knights of Labour, a labor
    movement that enjoyed enormous popularity and success during the penultimate
    decade of the 19th century, were unable to construct a resonant cultural
    frame in support of their platform of arbitration. The theoretical framework
    employed in this article is constructed by importing two concepts from
    political process models of social movement action into culturalist
    accounts, historical environment (or context), and opportunity. This
    framework allows me to look at how historical environments offer transient
    openings for the effective construction of counterhegemonic or subversive
    collective action frames. I argue that opportunity for framing has to do
    with the intersection between the signification requisites of framing
    practices, and the systemic features of cultural environments. I find that
    the nature of this opportunity in the years between 1885 and 1887 helps
    explain why movement practice within the Knights of Labour diverged so
    significantly from the practices advocated by its leadership.

    Annotation Are jury verdicts in business trials influenced less by a
    corporation's negligence than by sympathy for the plaintiffs, prejudice
    against business, and a belief in the corporation's "deep pockets"? Many
    members of the public and corporate executives believe that this is so, and
    they feel that the jury's decision making presents serious problems for
    American business competitiveness and its justice system. This book -- the
    first to provide a systematic account of how juries make decisions in
    typical business cases -- shows that these assumptions are false or
    exaggerated.Drawing on interviews with civil jurors, experiments with mock
    jurors, and public opinion polling, Valerie P. Hans explores how jurors
    determine whether businesses should be held responsible for an injury. She
    finds that many civil jurors, rather than being overly sympathetic to
    plaintiffs who bring civil lawsuits, are actually hostile to them, that
    there are only occasional instances of anti-business prejudice, and that
    there is no evidence of the deep-pockets hypothesis. Hans concludes that
    jurors do treat businesses differently than individuals, but this is because
    the public has higher expectations of corporations and more rigorous
    standards for their conduct.

    In the fifty years since it was published, The Other America has been
    established as a seminal work of sociology. This anniversary edition
    includes Michael Harrington’s essays on poverty in the 1970s and ’80s as
    well as a new introduction by Harrington’s biographer, Maurice Isserman.
    This illuminating, profoundly moving classic is still all too relevant for
    today’s America.When Michael Harrington’s masterpiece, The Other America,
    was first published in 1962, it was hailed as an explosive work and became a
    galvanizing force for the war on poverty. Harrington shed light on the lives
    of the poor—from farm to city—and the social forces that relegated them to
    their difficult situations. He was determined to make poverty in the United
    States visible and his observations and analyses have had a profound effect
    on our country, radically changing how we view the poor and the policies we
    employ to help them.

    The radical geographer guides us through the classic text of political

    in an effort to understand the origins of our current political and economic
    crisis.For nearly forty years, David Harvey has written and lectured on
    Capital, becoming one of the world’s foremost Marx scholars. Based on his
    recent lectures, this current volume—finally bringing together his guides to
    volumes I, II and much of III—presents this depth of learning to a broader
    audience, guiding first-time readers through a fascinating and deeply
    rewarding text. A Companion to Marx’s Capital offers fresh, original, and
    sometimes critical interpretations of a book that changed the course of
    history and, as Harvey intimates, may do so again.

    Sociolegal scholars have long acknowledged that the influence of law varies
    from one setting to another and that other normative systems also shape
    human action. Sociolegal scholars have also investigated the impact of law

    arising from overlapping institutional jurisdictions. To clarify when the
    law will be especially influential and when rival normative systems will

    Scholars have devoted attention to "cause lawyers" on the political left,
    but lawyers who work on the conservative side of the American political
    spectrum have received relatively little academic consideration. This
    article presents systematic data on the characteristics of and relationships
    among lawyers affiliated with organizations active on a selected set of 17
    conservative issues. We find that the lawyers serve several separate and
    distinct constituencies--business conservatives, Christian conservatives,
    libertarians, abortion opponents--and that the credentials of the lawyers
    serving these varying constituencies differ significantly. The greatest
    degree of social separation occurs between the business constituency and the
    abortion opponents, with another clear separation between libertarians and
    the interest groups devoted to traditional family values and order
    maintenance. The divisions among these constituencies appear to reflect the
    difference between "insider politics" and "populism," which is manifested in
    part in actual geographic separation between lawyers located in the District
    of Columbia and those in the South, West, and Midwest. In the center of the
    network, however, we find some potential "mediators"--prominent lawyers who
    may facilitate communication and coordination among the several
    constituencies. These lawyers and the organizations they serve attempt to
    merge morality, market freedom, and individual liberty concerns, and they
    convene meetings of diverse sets of lawyers and organizational leaders to
    seek consensus on policy goals. Nonetheless, the findings indicate that most
    organizations are seldom active on issues that lie beyond the relatively
    narrow boundaries of their own interests.

    A hypothesis that the urban bar is essentially divided into two distinct
    sectors or areas of practice was propounded in *Chicago Lawyers: The Social
    Structure of the Bar* (Heinz and Laumann 1982):  \[W]e have advanced the
    thesis that much of the differentiation within the legal profession is
    secondary to one fundamental distinction—the distinction between lawyers who
    represent large organizations (corporations, labor unions, or government)
    and those who represent individuals. The two kinds of law practice are the
    two hemispheres of the profession. Most lawyers reside exclusively in one
    hemisphere or the other and seldom, if ever, cross the equator.

    What determines the systematic allocation of status, power, and economic
    reward among lawyers? What kind of social structure organizes lawyers' roles
    in the bar and in the larger community? As Heinz and Laumann convincingly
    demonstrate, the legal profession is stratified primarily by the character
    of the clients served, not by the type of legal service rendered. In fact,
    the distinction between corporate and individual clients divides the bar
    into two remarkably separate hemispheres. Using data from extensive personal
    interviews with nearly 800 Chicago lawyers, the authors show that lawyers
    who serve one type of client seldom serve the other. Furthermore, lawyers'
    political, ethno-religious, and social ties are very likely to correspond to
    those of their client types. Greater deference is consistently shown to
    corporate lawyers, who seem to acquire power by association with their
    powerful clients. Heinz and Laumann also discover that these two
    "hemispheres" of the legal profession are not effectively integrated by
    intraprofessional organizations such as the bar, courts, or law schools. The
    fact that the bar is structured primarily along extraprofessional lines
    raises intriguing questions about the law and the nature of professionalism,
    questions addressed in a provocative and far-ranging final chapter. This
    volume, published jointly with the American Bar Foundation, offers a
    uniquely sophisticated and comprehensive analysis of lawyers' professional
    lives. It will be of exceptional importance to sociologists and others
    interested in the legal profession, in the general study of professions, and
    in social stratification and the distribution of power.

    Over the past several decades, the number of lawyers in large cities has
    doubled, women have entered the bar at an unprecedented rate, and the scale
    of firms has greatly expanded. This immense growth has transformed the
    nature and social structure of the legal profession. In the most
    comprehensive analysis of the urban bar to date, Urban Lawyers presents a
    compelling portrait of how these changes continue to shape the field of law
    today.  Drawing on extensive interviews with Chicago lawyers, the authors
    demonstrate how developments in the profession have affected virtually every
    aspect of the work and careers of urban lawyers-their relationships with
    clients, job tenure and satisfaction, income, social and political values,
    networks of professional connections, and patterns of participation in the
    broader community. Yet despite the dramatic changes, much remains the same.
    Stratification of income and power based on gender, race, and religious
    background, for instance, still maintains inequality within the bar.  The
    authors of Urban Lawyers conclude that organizational priorities will likely
    determine the future direction of the legal profession. And with this
    landmark study as their guide, readers will be able to make their own
    informed predictions.

    growth in newly certified collective bargaining representatives at private
    and public-sector institutions of higher education, particularly among
    non-tenure track faculty.  The data is analyzed in the context of legal
    decisions concerning employee status and unit composition under applicable
    federal and state laws.  Lastly, the article presents data concerning strike
    activities on campuses between January 2013 and May 31, 2017.

    The first book to examine the erosion of legal legitimacy in everyday life.
    Unlike previous studies on legal consciousness, it does not illustrate the
    'hegemony' of law but rather the 'progressive divorce of law from the
    consciousness of citizens'. Also, building on previous studies, this study
    will introduce the concept of 'legal alienation'.

  abstract: >-
    An innovator in contemporary thought on economic and political development
    looks here at decline rather than growth. Albert O. Hirschman makes a basic
    distinction between alternative ways of reacting to deterioration in
    business firms and, in general, to dissatisfaction with organizations: one,
    “exit,” is for the member to quit the organization or for the customer to
    switch to the competing product, and the other, “voice,” is for members or
    customers to agitate and exert influence for change “from within.” The
    efficiency of the competitive mechanism, with its total reliance on exit, is
    questioned for certain important situations. As exit often undercuts voice
    while being unable to counteract decline, loyalty is seen in the function of
    retarding exit and of permitting voice to play its proper role.The interplay
    of the three concepts turns out to illuminate a wide range of economic,
    social, and political phenomena. As the author states in the preface,
    “having found my own unifying way of looking at issues as diverse as
    competition and the two-party system, divorce and the American character,
    black power and the failure of ‘unhappy’ top officials to resign over
    Vietnam, I decided to let myself go a little.”

  abstract: >-
    With engaging wit and subtle irony, Albert Hirschman maps the diffuse and
    treacherous world of reactionary rhetoric in which conservative public
    figures, thinkers, and polemicists have been arguing against progressive
    agendas and reforms for the past two hundred years.Hirschman draws his
    examples from three successive waves of reactive thought that arose in
    response to the liberal ideas of the French Revolution and the Declaration
    of the Rights of Man, to democratization and the drive toward universal
    suffrage in the nineteenth century, and to the welfare state in our own
    century. In each case he identifies three principal arguments invariably
    used: (1) the perversity thesis, whereby any action to improve some feature
    of the political, social, or economic order is alleged to result in the
    exact opposite of what was intended; (2) the futility thesis, which predicts
    that attempts at social transformation will produce no effects whatever―will
    simply be incapable of making a dent in the status quo; (3) the jeopardy
    thesis, holding that the cost of the proposed reform is unacceptable because
    it will endanger previous hard-won accomplishments. He illustrates these
    propositions by citing writers across the centuries from Alexis de
    Tocqueville to George Stigler, Herbert Spencer to Jay Forrester, Edmund
    Burke to Charles Murray. Finally, in a lightning turnabout, he shows that
    progressives are frequently apt to employ closely related rhetorical
    postures, which are as biased as their reactionary counterparts. For those
    who aspire to the genuine dialogue that characterizes a truly democratic
    society, Hirschman points out that both types of rhetoric function, in
    effect, as contraptions designed to make debate impossible. In the process,
    his book makes an original contribution to democratic thought.The Rhetoric
    of Reaction is a delightful handbook for all discussions of public affairs,
    the welfare state, and the history of social, economic, and political
    thought, whether conducted by ordinary citizens or academics.

    In this volume, Albert Hirschman reconstructs the intellectual climate of
    the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to illuminate the intricate
    ideological transformation that occurred, wherein the pursuit of material
    interests--so long condemned as the deadly sin of avarice--was assigned the
    role of containing the unruly and destructive passions of man. Hirschman
    here offers a new interpretation for the rise of capitalism, one that
    emphasizes the continuities between old and new, in contrast to the
    assumption of a sharp break that is a common feature of both Marxian and
    Weberian thinking. Among the insights presented here is the ironical finding
    that capitalism was originally supposed to accomplish exactly what was soon
    denounced as its worst feature: the repression of the passions in favor of
    the "harmless," if one-dimensional, interests of commercial life. To portray
    this lengthy ideological change as an endogenous process, Hirschman draws on
    the writings of a large number of thinkers, including Montesquieu, Sir James
    Steuart, and Adam Smith. Featuring a new afterword by Jeremy Adelman and a
    foreword by Amartya Sen, this Princeton Classics edition of The Passions and
    the Interests sheds light on the intricate ideological transformation from
    which capitalism emerged triumphant, and reaffirms Hirschman's stature as
    one of our most influential and provocative thinkers.

    This article reports on a conducted systematic review focused on
    conceptualization and measurement methods of legal consciousness, which can
    be understood as the equivalent for the legitimacy of law. A systematic
    search identified 2,054 articles, resulting in the inclusion of 156 relevant
    articles after two phases of the screening process. Articles analyzed lacked
    a clear conceptualization of a legal consciousness construct and validated
    methods of its measurement with satisfactory quality. A considerable room
    for improvement was found for both conceptualization and measurement methods
    of legal consciousness. This review identifies six separate components of
    legal consciousness (general knowledge, skills, specific knowledge,
    attitudes, trust, and identity) and offers a unifying and comprehensive
    definition of legal consciousness based on those components. Using
    descriptive characteristics and inference statistics, main methodological
    weaknesses of selected articles were discussed and a set of criteria for
    optimal measurement method of legal consciousness was introduced.

    Can newly ascendant social movements revitalize the militant culture of
    older, institutionalized movements? Recent studies have focused on relations
    between new ascendant social movements like the civil rights, women's, and
    peace movements that emerged during the postwar cycle of protest, and
    therefore have been unable to address this question. Focusing on
    revitalization as a qualitatively different form of intermovement relation,
    the authors examine the possibility that civil rights movement insurgencies
    and organizations revitalized workplace labor militancy during the postwar
    decades. Time-series models show that the civil rights movement fueled an
    expanded militant worker culture that challenged management and sometimes
    union leadership. However, this revitalization of labor militancy was
    contingent on institutional context (stronger in the public sector than the
    private sector) and form of insurgent action (protests, riots,
    organizations) differentially embedded in historical phases (civil rights
    versus Black Power) of movement development. Theoretical implications for
    the study of social movements, industrial relations, and class conflict are
    discussed.

    Was the militant zeitgeist of the “long sixties” social movement wave
    harmful, irrelevant, or revitalizing for labor militancy and union growth?
    The authors extend research on intermovement relations by examining the
    influence of ascendant militancy of the new left–inspired mass movement wave
    on the organizational fortunes of labor. Time‐series models buttressed by
    secondary historical evidence show that “the movement,” as radical flank,
    did stimulate a militant oppositional culture that moved from the streets
    into workplaces. That oppositional culture was especially significant in the
    public sector, where it fueled union recognition strikes which, in turn,
    helped push the extension of collective bargaining laws in that sector,
    opening the door for union growth. The authors consider implications for
    social movement theory and labor movement revitalization.

    In this book, Jane Jacobs, building on the work of her debut, The Death and
    Life of Great American Cities, investigates the delicate way cities balance
    the interplay between the domestic production of goods and the ever-changing
    tide of imports. Using case studies of developing cities in the ancient,
    pre-agricultural world, and contemporary cities on the decline, like the
    financially irresponsible New York City of the mid-sixties, Jacobs
    identifies the main drivers of urban prosperity and growth, often via
    counterintuitive and revelatory lessons.

  abstract: "\"Thought provoking and fresh - this book challenges how we think about economics.”Gillian Tett, Financial Times For further information about recent publicity events and media coverage for Rethinking Capitalism please visit http://marianamazzucato.com/rethinking-capitalism/ Western capitalism is in crisis. For decades investment has been falling, living standards have stagnated or declined, and inequality has risen dramatically. Economic policy has neither reformed the financial system nor restored stable growth. Climate change meanwhile poses increasing risks to future prosperity.\_ In this book some of the world’s leading economists propose new ways of thinking about capitalism. In clear and compelling prose, each chapter shows how today’s deep economic problems reflect the inadequacies of orthodox economic theory and the failure of policies informed by it. The chapters examine a range of contemporary economic issues, including fiscal and monetary policy, financial markets and business behaviour, inequality and privatisation, and innovation and environmental change. The authors set out alternative economic approaches which better explain how capitalism works, why it often doesn’t, and how it can be made more innovative, inclusive and sustainable. Outlining a series of far-reaching policy reforms, Rethinking Capitalism\_offers a powerful challenge to mainstream economic debate, and new ideas to transform it."

    Resource mobilization theory has recently presented an alternative
    interpretation of social movements. The review traces the emergence and
    recent controversies generated by this new perspective. A multifactored
    model of social movement formation is advanced, emphasizing resources,
    organization, and political opportunities in addition to traditional
    discontent hypotheses. The McCarthy-Zald (1973) theory of entrepreneurial
    mobilization is critically assessed as an interpretation of the social
    movements of the 1960s-1970s, and the relevance of the Olson (1968) theory
    of collective action is specified. Group organization is argued to be the
    major determinant of mobilization potential and patterns. The debate between
    the Gerlach-Hine (1970) and entrepreneurial theories of social movement
    organization is traced in terms of historical changes in the social movement
    sector and the persistence of organizational diversity. A model of social
    movement politics is outlined, building on Gamson's (1975) theory of
    strategy and Tilly's (1978) polity theory by emphasizing political alliances
    and processes shaping success and failure. Piven & Cloward (1977) are
    correct that disruptiveness leads to success and that disruptions can be
    mobilized without formal organization; they are wrong in asserting that
    formal organization is necessarily incompatible with mobilization. The
    future development of resource mobilization theory lies in two directions:
    extending the polity theory to deal with different states and regimes,
    including the development of neo-corporatism, and providing a more
    sophisticated social psychology of mobilization.

    A notable theme of public discourse in Canada is the naming of nations.
    Denominating nations involves much more than the ethnic labeling familiar in
    polyethnic states like the United States, where Italian-Americans,
    Asian-Americans, and so on seek political recognition.¹ As in other
    multinational states, much of Canadian politics in the past three decades
    has involved competing assertions of nationhood, some of which reject the
    very label “Canadian.”  As Benedict Anderson tells us, nations are “imagined
    communities” that claim sovereignty and recognize a limited number of people
    as members (1991: 6-7). They identify an “us,” which can be distinguished

    This paper addresses two issues pertaining to legal pluralism in capture
    fisheries, particularly with regard to the South. First there is the problem
    of analysis. If legal pluralism is a common phenomenon, how is it to be
    discerned and understood? Secondly, there is the matter of institutional
    design: given the pervasiveness of legal pluralism, which management
    institutions are better suited to represent and resolve inter-legal system
    differences? The authors argue the case of co-management. Drawing on
    examples and insights from a comparative research project in South Asia,
    four basic types of legal pluralism and co-management are distinguished. The
    authors conclude that co-management is a process that brings legal systems,
    and their constituent organizations and groups, together within a single
    framework. For fisher organizations, which frequently have distinct legal
    perspectives, co-management is an essential path to legitimacy. For the
    state, other legal systems are a resource that management can draw upon.

    This volume develops a novel approach to state theory. It offers a
    comprehensive review of the existing literature on the state and sets a new
    agenda for state research. Four central themes define the scope of the book:
    an account of the bases of the operational autonomy of the state; the need
    to develop state theory as part of a more general social theory; the
    possibilities of explaining 'capitalist societalization' without assuming
    that the economy is the ultimate determinant of societal dynamics; and a
    defence of the method of articulation in theory construction. In developing
    these issues, Bob Jessop both builds on and goes well beyond the view
    presented in his earlier books, The Capitalist State (1982) and Nicos
    Poulantzas (1985). The result is a highly original statement which will
    become a center-point of discussion. The volume confirms the author's
    standing as one of the most important post-War Marxist state theorists.

  abstract: >-
    Debates about the role and nature of the state are at the heart of modern
    politics. However, the state itself remains notoriously difficult to define,
    and the term is subject to a range of different interpretations. In this
    book, distinguished state theorist Bob Jessop provides a critical
    introduction to the state as both a concept and a reality. He lucidly guides
    readers through all the major accounts of the state, and examines competing
    efforts to relate the state to other features of social organization.
    Essential themes in the analysis of the state are explored in full,
    including state formation, periodization, the re-scaling of the state and
    the state's future. Throughout, Jessop clearly defines key terms, from
    hegemony and coercion to government and governance. He also analyses what we
    mean when we speak about 'normal'and 'exceptional' states, and states that
    are 'failed' or 'rogue'.Combining an accessible style with expert
    sensitivity to the complexities of the state, this short introduction will
    be core reading for students and scholars of politics and sociology, as well
    as anyone interested in the changing role of the state in contemporary
    societies.

    During the 1960s and 70s the United States environmental movement
    experienced dramatic growth in both absolute size and in the diversity of
    organizational structures and issues represented within the movement. We
    assess the importance of change in movement size and compositional diversity
    on two important stages within the legislative process. Findings indicate
    that U.S. environmental movement size is positively associated with the
    incidence of Congressional environmental agenda-setting activities, but not
    the passage of environmental laws. An increased diversity of issue
    representation within the movement is consistently and positively associated
    with the incidence of agenda setting and law-passage activity. The growth of
    EMOs attending simultaneously to both traditional conservation and "new"
    quality of life issues, in particular, is associated with elevated rates of
    policy activity.

    In social movement analysis, the framing perspective has been at the
    forefront of renewed interest in cultural and ideational processes. But
    several persistent problems in frame analysis remain: how to do it
    systematically, for example, and how to verify the content and relationships
    between the concepts within frames that have been identified. This chapter
    is a methodological essay— both practical and conceptual—that introduces one
    way by which frames can be studied. It specifies certain procedures that
    allow the analyst to demonstrate the relations between concepts, knowledge,
    and experience that constitutute social movement frames, and to speak more
    convincingly about

    The pendulum of Kuhn’s normal science now seems to swing toward culture,
    gathering speed in what may well be a paradigmatic shift. Mueller (1992) in
    her introductory essay to *Frontiers in Social Movement Theory* —in more
    than one sense the predecessor of this volume—refers to a broader paradigm,
    more sensitive to cultural factors, that is developing. In the collection
    she and Morris edited (Morris and Mueller 1992), culture as such is not yet
    central stage, but by placing culture at the center of our concerns the
    current volume clearly embraces and labels a theoretical trend that was
    already emerging

    In what ways and to what extent does regulation matter in shaping corporate
    behavior? How important is it compared to other incentives and mechanisms of
    social control, and how does it interact with those mechanisms? As all firms
    do not respond in the same way to law or to other external pressures, how do
    we understand variation in corporate behavior?  In seeking to answer these
    questions, the sociolegal and policy literature on regulatory administration
    traditionally has focused on explaining corporate compliance and
    noncompliance with existing legal requirements. The tacit assumption has

    The prevalence of nonstandard jobs is a matter of concern if, as many
    assume, such jobs are bad. We examine the relationship between nonstandard
    employment (on-call work and day labor, temporary-help agency employment,
    employment with contract companies, independent contracting, other
    self-employment, and part-time employment in "conventional" jobs) and
    exposure to "bad" job characteristics, using data from the 1995 Current
    Population Survey. Of workers age 18 and over, 31 percent are in some type
    of nonstandard employment. To assess the link between type of employment and
    bad jobs, we conceptualize "bad jobs" as those with low pay and without
    access to health insurance and pension benefits. About one in seven jobs in
    the United States is bad on these three dimensions. Nonstandard employment
    strongly increases workers' exposure to bad job characteristics, net of
    controls for workers' personal characteristics, family status, occupation,
    and industry.

    This comprehensive textbook provides an introduction to collective
    bargaining and labor relations with a focus on developments in the United
    States. It is appropriate for students, policy analysts, and labor relations
    professionals including unionists, managers, and neutrals. A three-tiered
    strategic choice framework unifies the text, and the authors’ thorough
    grounding in labor history and labor law assists students in learning the
    basics. In addition to traditional labor relations, the authors address
    emerging forms of collective representation and movements that address
    income inequality in novel ways.Harry C. Katz, Thomas A. Kochan, and
    Alexander J. S. Colvin provide numerous contemporary illustrations of
    business and union strategies. They consider the processes of contract
    negotiation and contract administration with frequent comparisons to
    nonunion practices and developments, and a full chapter is devoted to
    special aspects of the public sector. An Introduction to U.S. Collective
    Bargaining and Labor Relations has an international scope, covering labor
    rights issues associated with the global supply chain as well as the growing
    influence of NGOs and cross-national unionism. The authors also compare how
    labor relations systems in Germany, Japan, China, India, Brazil, and South
    Africa compare to practices in the United States.The textbook is
    supplemented by a website (ilr.cornell.edu/scheinman-institute) that
    features an extensive Instructor’s Manual with a test bank, PowerPoint
    chapter outlines, mock bargaining exercises, organizing cases, grievance
    cases, and classroom-ready current events materials.

    One of the best-known and most-quoted books ever written on labor unions is
    What Do Unions Do? by Richard Freeman and James Medoff. Published in 1984,
    the book proved to be a landmark because it provided the most comprehensive
    and statistically sophisticated empirical portrait of the economic and
    socio-political effects of unions, and a provocative conclusion that unions
    are on balance beneficial for the economy and society.The present volume
    represents a twentieth-anniversary retrospective and evaluation of What Do
    Unions Do? The objectives are threefold: to evaluate and critique the
    theory, evidence, and conclusions of Freeman and Medoff; to provide a
    comprehensive update of the theoretical and empirical literature on unions
    since the publication of their book; and to offer a balanced assessment and
    critique of the effects of unions on the economy and society. Toward this
    end, internationally recognized representatives of labor and management
    cover the gamut of subjects related to unions.Topics covered include the
    economic theory of unions; the history of economic thought on unions; the
    effect of unions on wages, benefits, capital investment, productivity,
    income inequality, dispute resolution, and job satisfaction; the performance
    of unions in an international perspective; the reasons for the decline of
    unions; and the future of unions. The volume concludes with a chapter by
    Richard Freeman in which he assesses the arguments and evidence presented in
    the other chapters and presents his evaluation of how What Do Unions Do?
    stands up in the light of twenty years of additional experience and
    research. This highly readable volume is a state-of-the-art survey by
    internationally recognized experts on the effects and future of labor
    unions. It will be the benchmark for years to come.

    Scholarship on law and social movements has focused attention primarily on
    the United States, and secondarily on countries that share the
    Anglo-American legal tradition. The politics of law and social movements in
    other national legal contexts remains underexamined. The analysis in this
    article contrasts legal mobilizations for immigrant rights in France and the
    United States, and explores the relations between national fields of power
    and legal practices. I trace the institutionalization of immigrant rights
    legal organizations in each country and argue that the divergent
    organizational forms and litigation strategies adopted by professionalized
    movement organizations reflect the dynamics of the nationally distinct
    fields of power relations within which law reform has been conducted. My
    analysis links the material and symbolic resources available to law
    reformers to the relative authority of private and public juridical actors
    in each state.

  abstract: >-
    America has long enjoyed a love/hate relationship with its attorneys; jokes
    equating lawyers with vermin abound at the same time that our love of
    litigation is reflected in a doubling of the ranks of lawyers since the
    1960s. Though we often see the lawyer as a crusading lone wolf of justice,
    the illuminating Lives of Lawyers demonstrates that the integrity of
    individual lawyers is fundamentally influenced by the nature of the legal
    organizations that have come to dominate the field. In fleshing out these
    agencies of legal expertise, Kelly offers important insights into the
    personal ideals of lawyers, the struggle to clarify professionalism as
    interpreted by the legal origination, and the effects of these factors on
    society's perceptions of law and lawyering. Lives of Lawyers paints an
    intimate portrait of five legal entities: two corporate firms, an in-house
    corporate counsel's office, and a public interest agency. Each is viewed
    through a kaleidoscope of client/colleague relationships, connections to
    civic and community life, income levels and career satisfaction of
    attorneys, the social status of the organization, and the character of the
    particular law practiced. These detailed portrayals vividly reveal the
    diversity inherent to the profession and the wealth of responses to the
    question of what shapes the values of today's legal practices. The author's
    deft use of narrative and debt to the discipline of biography and sociology
    make his five stores a first-rate read. Kelly gets into the trenches with
    lawyers comprising these organizations; they don't mince words in passing
    judgment on themselves, their employers, or the state of the
    profession--particularly its growing commercialism. Nonetheless, Lives of
    Lawyers reminds us of the constantly renewed dedication by lawyers to the
    principles of legal professionalism. Michael J. Kelly is University Vice
    President and Professor of Law, Georgetown University.

  abstract: >-
    The past two decades have seen profound changes in the legal profession.
    Lives of Lawyers Revisited extends Michael Kelly’s work in the original
    Lives of Lawyers, offering unique insights into the nature of these changes,
    examined through stories of five extraordinarily varied law practices. By
    placing the spotlight on organizations as phenomena that generate their own
    logic and tensions, Lives of Lawyers Revisited speaks to the experience of
    many lawyers and anticipates important issues on the professional horizon.
    "Michael Kelly has done it again! His Lives of Lawyers Revisited is a very
    easy read about some very difficult notions like 'litigation blindness' and
    law as a business. It presents some fascinating perspectives on our
    profession." —J. Michael McWilliams, Past President, American Bar
    Association "The best single book about the American realities and
    possibilities of the American legal profession, combining an empathic and
    insightful account of law practice with a penetrating analysis of the wider
    context of professional work." —Marc Galanter, University of Wisconsin
    "Michael Kelly believes that professional values and conduct are not
    realized in codes, but in the experiences of practice, and that practice
    draws its routines and ideals from organizations. Through his studies of
    lawyers in various firms, closely observed and sympathetically described,
    Kelly reveals how differently organizations adapt to the intense pressures
    of today's practice environment. His method of linking individual
    life-experiences to organizational strategies and the external constraints
    of competition and client demands infuses realism and richness into the
    concept of professionalism and makes this one of the most interesting and
    original books on professions and professionalism to appear in years."
    —Robert W. Gordon, Yale Law School "In his two volumes of Lives of Lawyers,
    Michael Kelly explores legal ethics in an unusual, and unusually rewarding,
    way. Rather than focusing on rules or arguments, Kelly looks at the kind of
    lives lawyers lead. Ethics, Socrates thought, is about how to live one's
    life, and Kelly takes the Socratic question to heart. He explores the
    institutions lawyers work in and the choices they make. He writes with
    intelligence, great insight, and above all with heart. This is a superb
    book." —David Luban, Georgetown University Michael J. Kelly is President and
    Chairman of the Board of the National Senior Citizens Law Center, an
    advocacy group for older Americans of limited means.

    First published in 1982, this pioneering work traces the transformation of
    "women's work" into wage labor in the United States, identifying the social,
    economic, and ideological forces that have shaped our expectations of what
    women do. Basing her observations upon the personal experience of individual
    American women set against the backdrop of American society, Alice
    Kessler-Harris examines the effects of class, ethnic and racial patterns,
    changing perceptions of wage work for women, and the relationship between
    wage-earning and family roles. In the 20th Anniversary Edition of this
    landmark book, the author has updated the original and written a new
    Afterword.

    Out to Work: A History of Wage-Earning Women in the United States, 20th
    Anniversary Edition

- id: kessler-harrisPursuitEquityWomen2001
  abstract: >-
    Few historians have contributed more to our understanding of the history of
    women, and women's effect on history, than Alice Kessler-Harris. Author of
    the classic Out to Work, she is one of the country's leading scholars of
    gender, the economy, and public policy.  In this volume, Kessler-Harris
    pierces the skin of arguments and legislation to grasp the preconceptions
    that have shaped the experience of women: a "gendered imagination" that has
    defined what men and women alike think of as fair and desirable. In this
    brilliant account that traces social policy from the New Deal to the 1970s,
    she shows how a deeply embedded set of beliefs has distorted seemingly
    neutral social legislation to further limit the freedom and equality of
    women. Government rules generally sought to protect women from exploitation,
    even from employment itself; but at the same time, they attached the most
    important benefits to wage work. To be a real citizen, one must earn--and
    most policymakers (even female ones) assumed from the beginning that women
    were not, and should not be breadwinners. Kessler-Harris traces the impact
    of this gender bias in the New Deal programs of Social Security,
    unemployment insurance, and fair labor standards, in Federal income tax
    policy, and the new discussion of women's rights that emerged after World
    War II. "For generations," she writes, "American women lacked not merely the
    practice, but frequently the idea of individual economic freedom." Only in
    the 1960s and '70s did old assumptions begin to break down--yet the process
    is far from complete.  Even today, with women closer to full economic
    citizenship than ever before, Kessler-Harris's insights offer a keen new
    understanding of the issues that dominate the headlines, from the marriage
    penalty in the tax code to the glass ceiling in corporate America.

    A classic since its original publication, Women Have Always Worked brought
    much-needed insight into the ways work has shaped female lives and
    sensibilities. Beginning in the colonial era, Alice Kessler-Harris looks at
    the public and private work spheres of diverse groups of women—housewives
    and trade unionists, immigrants and African Americans, professionals and
    menial laborers, and women from across the class spectrum. She delves into
    issues ranging from the gendered nature of the success ethic to the social
    activism and the meaning of citizenship for female wage workers. This second
    edition adds artwork and features significant updates. A new chapter by
    Kessler-Harris follows women into the early twenty-first century as they
    confront barriers of race, sex, and class to earn positions in the new
    information society.

  abstract: >-
    During the last three decades of the nineteenth century Czech nationalist
    politicians sharply criticized the cultural choices and political
    allegiances of the Jewish population of the Bohemian lands. The Jews'
    linguistic practices, educational strategies, and voting patterns—the
    critics charged—demonstrated that they had taken sides in the increasingly
    heated struggle for power between Czech and German activists, lending their
    support to a presumed project for German linguistic and cultural hegemony.
    This article examines the origins of Jewish political culture in the
    Bohemian lands in the context of the late-Enlightenment imperial project
    that aimed to modernize Jewish institutions and create Jewish imperial
    subjects through education to the high culture of the state. This
    acculturation was assumed to require a German linguistic complexion, but its
    political ideology and loyalties were imperial—and liberal—not national.
    What ethnic politicians of the late nineteenth century were demanding of
    Jews in their midst amounted to a reduction of perspective, a shift from the
    imperial to the local and from state to nation. Many Jews in the Bohemian
    lands, in fact, met this demand, having learned the need to articulate
    individual and collective identity in national terms. The Czech Jewish
    movement was one result; so, too, was Prague Zionism.

    Everyone is talking about fat people. Contemporary American society is
    experiencing a period of intense media attention and general cultural
    anxiety over the so-called obesity epidemic. Being fat is highly stigmatized
    and, following the tone of mass media coverage, most people attribute it to
    individual choices and behaviors. Attention to obesity supports narratives
    about the decline of American society from across the political spectrum. On
    the right, decrying obesity leads naturally to calls for greater personal
    responsibility and aids in dramatizing the dangerous expenses of national
    health care. On the left, critics target Big Food, corn subsidies, and junk

    consequences and challenges of advice work in the UK, presenting a rare and
    rich view of the world of advice giving. Based on original research it
    examines how advisors negotiate the private troubles of those who come to
    Citizens Advice Bureaux (CAB) and construct ways forward. Exploring how
    advisors are trained, the strong contributor team reflect on the challenges
    facing Citizens Advice Bureaux in the future, where austerity will ensure
    that the need for advice services increase, while funding for such services
    declines.

    In a pre-registered 2 × 2 × 2 factorial between-subject randomized lab
    experiment with 61 federal judges, we test if the law influences judicial
    decisions, if it does so more under a rule than under a standard, and how
    its influence compares to that of legally irrelevant sympathies.
    Participating judges received realistic materials and a relatively long
    period of time (50 min) to decide an auto accident case. We find at best
    weak evidence that the law matters or that rules constrain more than
    standards, and no evidence of a sympathy effect. (JEL K00, K13, K40, K41)

    The United States Constitution is the foundational document of the longest
    and most successful democratic experiment in modern human history. It not
    only serves as the legal bedrock for the world's most powerful nation-state
    but also, more broadly, reflects that nation's fundamental commitments as a
    society.; Who then has the authority to interpret a blueprint of such
    extraordinary influence? Americans have come to treat the Constitution as
    somehow beyond the purview, even the competence, of the average American
    citizen. Only lawyers, judges, and academics are deemed fit to state what
    exactly the Constitution means. This elitist reliance on expert judgement is
    a radical and troublesome departure from the founding fathers' intent.
    America's Founding generation, in darling contrast, embraced a; political
    ideology that celebrated the central role of the "the people" in supplying
    government with its energy and direction, an ideal that remained at all
    times in the forefront of their thinking-Federalist and Anti-Federalist
    alike.; In this groundbreaking interpretation of America's founding and of
    its entire system of judicial review, Larry Kramer reveals that the
    colonists fought for and birthed a very different system - and held a very
    different understanding of citizenship - than Americans believe to be the
    norm today. "Popular sovreignty" was no historical abstraction nor was the
    notion of "the people" invoked largely as a flip rhetorical convenience on
    the campaign trail. Important trials and the prospective passage; of the
    influentional legislation such as the Alien Act - which granted a president
    the power to imprison or even deport immigrants - were met with vigorous
    public debate. The outcomes were greeted with celebratory feasts and
    bonfires, or riotous resistance. In short, Americans drew a clear parallel;
    between the law and the lived reality of their daily existence. Theis
    self-sovreignty in law as much as politics was active not abstract.; With
    this book, Larry Kramer vaults to the forefront of Constitutional
    interpretation. In the process, he rekindles the original spark of "we the
    people", inviting every citizen to join him in enlivening the seemingly
    deadened sensibilities that mark the relationship between Americans and
    their constitutional past, present, and future.

    The German sociologist Norbert Elias developed a wide-ranging sociological
    analysis of the interconnections between processes of state formation,
    institutional dynamics, and individual subjectivity, or habitus, and the
    logic of their processes of transformation over time. His work has had
    significant impact on social scientific thought in a wide variety of fields,
    including the historical sociology of the self, violence, crime and
    punishment, organizations, emotions, sexuality, social control, and sport.
    His influence in legal scholarship, however, has concentrated in
    criminology, with only sporadic use of his ideas in relation to other topics
    in law and social science research. This review highlights the ways in which
    Elias can be read as a theorist of regulation by outlining (a) the core
    elements of Elias&apos;s “process-figurational” sociology and his analysis
    of processes of civilization and decivilization; (b) Elias&apos;s
    observations on law and state formation; (c) a selection of the sociolegal
    research related to his sociological approach, in fields such as crime and
    punishment, evolving modes of regulation, and international relations; and
    (d) the potential future directions in which Elias&apos;s
    process-figurational approach might move in sociolegal research and
    scholarship. These include the emotional dimensions of family law, human
    rights and humanitarianism, the intersections of legal evolution and broader
    processes of social change, legal pluralism and legal culture, tort law,
    constitutionalism, and the rule of law.

    All professionals make mistakes and sometimes those mistakes harm the
    clients or patients. What happens when this occurs and the professional
    involved is a lawyer? Surprisingly, there is virtually no empirical research
    on legal malpractice. In contrast, there is an extensive empirical 
    literature on medical malpractice and the legal handling of legal
    malpractice claims. This literature examines the frequency of medical
    malpractice claims, how they are handled, how they are resolved, and their
    impact on access to and cost of medical care. The absence of a similar
    literature concerning legal malpractice is at least somewhat surprising
    given that there are roughly equal numbers of private practice lawyers and
    patient care physicians in the United States.

    Case-control designs involve samples stratified disproportionately on a
    binary dependent variable. This design, though infrequently used by
    sociologists, offers tremendous logistical efficiency in the study of rare
    events, such as divorce, joining a religious cult, or committing a crime.
    This paper attempts to sensitize sociologists to the many situations in
    which this design is useful, and offers general and accessible guidance on
    the practice of case-control research. Using the epidemiologic literature, I
    explain the underlying logic of case-control design, discuss how to conduct
    case-control sampling, and briefly cover data analysis issues. I conclude
    with an empirical illustration of a case-control study examining factors
    associated with the change of chief administrative officers at
    post-secondary educational institutions.

    American labor law classifies strikes according to both purpose and form. In
    terms of purpose, a strike over terms and conditions of employment is an
    economic strike while one over an employer's violations of federal labor law
    is an unfair labor practice strike. With respect to form, the subcategories
    are less clear, but the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board) and
    the courts have distinguished between full strikes, which receive protection
    under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Act), and certain categories
    of nontraditional strikes, such as intermittent and partial strikes, which
    do not. In removing such strike forms from the protection of federal labor
    law, the Board and courts have declined to expressly differentiate between
    nontraditional strikes stemming from different purposes. While unfair labor
    practice strikers receive greater protection from replacement by employers,
    neither the Board nor the federal courts have allowed for expansion of the
    scope of protected nontraditional strike activity for such strikers.
    Instead, the Board and courts have at times skirted the question of whether
    a separate standard is necessary, developing elusive exemptions from the
    traditional rule to protect workers engaged in these strikes. The
    justifications for finding certain forms of nontraditional strikes
    unprotected under the Act stem from a theory that such labor action should
    be left to the free play of economic forces. This Note argues that the scope
    of protected forms of concerted activity available to unfair labor practice
    strikers should be broader given that these strikes' primary purpose is not
    to wage an economic battle but, alternatively, to compel an employer to
    comply with the requirements of existing labor law.

    Law and society scholars challenge the common belief that law is simply a
    neutral tool by which society sets standards and resolves disputes. Decades
    of research shows how much the nature of communities, organizations, and the
    people inhabiting them affect how law works. Just as much, law shapes
    beliefs, behaviors, and wider social structures, but the connections are
    much more nuancedOCoand surprisingOCothan many expect. Law and Society
    Reader II provides readers an accessible overview to the breadth of recent
    developments in this research tradition, bringing to life the developments
    in this dynamic field. Following up a first Law and Society Reader published
    in 1995, editors Erik W. Larson and Patrick D. Schmidt have compiled
    excerpts of 43 illuminating articles published since 1993 in The Law &
    Society Review, the flagship journal of the Law and Society Association. By
    its organization and approach, this volume enables readers to join in
    discussing the key ideas of law and society research. The selections
    highlight the core insights and developments in this research tradition,
    making these works indispensable for those exploring the field and ideal for
    classroom use. Across six concisely-introduced sections, this volume
    analyzes inequality, lawyering, the relation between law and organizations,
    and the place of law in relation to other social institutions."

    The process of specialization is now well advanced within the legal
    profession, and the specialties have acquired clearly varying levels of
    prestige among the practicing bar. What are the characteristics of the
    specialties, or of the lawyers who practice in them, that might account for
    these variations in prestige? In describing the prestige differences and
    several of the variables that might be thought to account for them, the
    authors analyze the results of a survey of a large random sample of Chicago
    lawyers. Among the findings are a strong relationship between prestige
    within the legal profession and the type of clients that the specialty
    serves, a substantial correlation between prestige and the degree of
    intellectual challenge presented by the subject matter of the specialty, and
    the perhaps surprising result that prestige is not significantly associated
    with the income earned by lawyers practicing in the specialty. The authors
    conclude that legal specialties that regularly confront personal suffering
    lose social standing as a result, that prestige within the profession is
    directly proportional to the degree to which the specialty facilitates the
    conduct of corporate enterprise, and that the varying prestige of the
    specialties is likely to affect the political and professional power of the
    lawyers who practice in them and to influence the patterns of recruitment of
    lawyers into law practice.

    Using data from personal interviews with 777 Chicago lawyers, constituting a
    random cross section of the urban bar, the authors estimate the relative
    volumes of effort devoted to each of several fields of law, analyze the
    degree to which practitioners specialize in fields or groups of fields, and
    examine the patterns of co-practice of the fields. They find that the total
    effort of the Chicago bar is about evenly divided between work for corporate
    clients and work for individual clients. They also suggest that, while
    relatively few lawyers are highly specialized to a particular doctrinal area
    of the law, most are specialized to the service of the needs of a particular
    type of client. Exploring possible implications of their findings, the
    authors speculate that lawyers who are specialized to clients rather than to
    substantive fields may lack the incentive to devote their resources to the
    rationalization of legal doctrine.

    While it is possible to define ANT in a series of abstract bullet points to
    do so is to miss most of the point. Instead it explores and theorises the
    world through rich case studies. This means that, like symbolic
    interactionism, for ANT words are never enough: you need to practice it. In
    this paper we work empirically, drawing on an ANT-inflected ethnography of
    Norwegian salmon farming, and also dialogically. We do this because we want
    to show that for ANT theory is created, recreated, explored and tinkered
    with in particular research practices. Indeed, ANT is probably best
    understood as a sensibility, a set of empirical interferences in the world,
    a worldly practice, or a lively craft that cherishes the slow processes of
    knowing rather than immediately seeking results or closure. In particular it
    is sensible to materiality, relationality, heterogeneity, and process. At
    its best it understands itself as working in the world to create analytical
    contexts; but also on the world, to articulate and press particular contexts
    and their politics. As a part of this it explores the contingencies of
    power, generating tools to undo the inevitability of that power, while
    working on the assumption that other and better worlds are possible.

    English colonists settled Antigua [one of the Leeward Islands in the eastern

    slave society known principally for the quantity and quality of its sugar.
    Slavery ended in 1834, but the vast majority of the working population
    remained tied to labor on the estates because there was little available
    land either to cultivate or to purchase. Planters ran the island’s economy
    and its local government until almost the middle of the 20th century. Since
    the 1950s the economy has shifted away from sugar and other agricultural

    "Right to work" states weaken collective bargaining rights and limit the
    ability of unions to effectively advocate on behalf of workers. As more and
    more states consider enacting right-to-work laws, observers trace the
    contemporary attack on organized labor to the 1980s and the Reagan era. In
    The Origins of Right to Work, however, Cedric de Leon contends that this
    antagonism began a century earlier with the Northern victory in the U.S.
    Civil War, when the political establishment revised the English common-law
    doctrine of conspiracy to equate collective bargaining with the enslavement
    of free white men. In doing so, de Leon connects past and present, raising
    critical questions that address pressing social issues. Drawing on the
    changing relationship between political parties and workers in
    nineteenth-century Chicago, de Leon concludes that if workers’ collective
    rights are to be preserved in a global economy, workers must chart a course
    of political independence and overcome long-standing racial and ethnic
    divisions.

    This article presents findings from a qualitative study of seventy-one New
    York immigration lawyers who are engaged in private practice. It focuses on
    the lawyers' backgrounds, career paths, and early professional training and
    describes, inter alia, the unusual diversity of this bar, the lawyers'
    reasons for practicing immigration law, the ways in which they learn to
    practice law, and the strong sense of community within the private
    immigration bar. It uses the idea of communities of practice to help
    understand how lawyers learn from their colleagues and are influenced by
    them. The article identifies several factors that may contribute to the
    supportiveness of the bar and the strong sense of community within that
    practice specialty, notwithstanding its great diversity. It concludes by
    making some preliminary comparisons between immigration lawyers and lawyers
    in other practice specialties and by identifying some questions for future
    study.

    How do lawyers resolve ethical dilemmas in the everyday context of their
    practice? What are the issues that commonly arise, and how do lawyers
    determine the best ways to resolve them? Until recently, efforts to answer
    these questions have focused primarily on rules and legal doctrine rather
    than the real-life situations lawyers face in legal practice.  The first
    book to present empirical research on ethical decision making in a variety
    of practice contexts, including corporate litigation, securities,
    immigration, and divorce law, Lawyers in Practice fills a substantial gap in
    the existing literature. Following an introduction emphasizing the
    increasing importance of understanding context in the legal profession,
    contributions focus on ethical dilemmas ranging from relatively narrow
    ethical issues to broader problems of professionalism, including the
    prosecutor’s obligation to disclose evidence, the management of conflicts of
    interest, and loyalty to clients and the court. Each chapter details the
    resolution of a dilemma from the practitioner’s point of view that is, in
    turn, set within a particular community of practice. Timely and practical,
    this book should be required reading for law students as well as students
    and scholars of law and society.

    “Just When I Thought I Was Out . . . .”: Post-Employment Repayment
    Obligations
  type: article-journal
  volume: '25'

- id: Lichtenstein2000
  abstract: >-
    The historiography of US labor during the Second World War has shifted away
    from New Left concerns with the fate of working-class militancy, becoming
    more attuned instead to the structure and development of the New Deal order.
    A quarter century ago, historians debated the extent to which the warfare
    state had emasculated working-class radicalism and constructed in its place
    a bureaucratized, corporate-liberal labor movement. Few scholars doubted
    that trade unions were a fixed and permanent feature of the postwar
    political economy. But in the decades following the presidency of Ronald
    Reagan, when the legal, ideological, and economic structures sustaining the
    institutional union movement are so weak, the agenda of most historians and
    social scientists has shifted to one that problematizes the rise,
    consolidation, and postwar devolution of the mid-century New Deal
    settlement. For US labor and other popular social movements, World War Two
    had a dichotomous character. In both politics and policy, war-era
    corporatist structures failed to win lasting institutional expressions,
    either during the war or in the decades following 1945. There was no
    "labor-management accord," although labor's strength did generate a kind of
    armed truce in key oligopolistic sectors of the economy. Anti-New-Deal
    conservatives in Congress and the corporate hierarchy sought, above all, to
    divorce industrial relations issues from the larger political universe. This
    was the meaning of "free" collective bargaining in the years after 1947. But
    during the war and reconversion years right afterward, elite power at the
    top of the mobilization apparatus was repeatedly challenged by insurgencies
    from below that sought to take advantage of the unprecedented demand for
    labor while at the same time actualizing the pluralist, social-patriotic
    ethos that was the quasi-official ideology of the World War Two home front.
    These social movements were a dialectical product of the mobilizing
    bureaucracies—the War Labor Board, the Fair Employment Practice Commission,
    and the Office of Price Administration—that were among the most remarkable
    features of the wartime New Deal. Indeed, this increasingly contentious
    juxtaposition between a state apparatus drifting rightward and a
    well-organized working class represents the great paradox of the war, a
    dichotomy that would be resolved in the postwar years by a rapid,
    politically brutal divorce between popular aspirations and the state
    policies needed to fulfill them.

  abstract: >-
    In a fresh and timely reinterpretation, Nelson Lichtenstein examines how
    trade unionism has waxed and waned in the nation's political and moral
    imagination, among both devoted partisans and intransigent foes. From the
    steel foundry to the burger-grill, from Woodrow Wilson to John Sweeney, from
    Homestead to Pittston, Lichtenstein weaves together a compelling matrix of
    ideas, stories, strikes, laws, and people in a streamlined narrative of work
    and labor in the twentieth century. The "labor question" became a burning
    issue during the Progressive Era because its solution seemed essential to
    the survival of American democracy itself. Beginning there, Lichtenstein
    takes us all the way to the organizing fever of contemporary Los Angeles,
    where the labor movement stands at the center of the effort to transform
    millions of new immigrants into alert citizen unionists. He offers an
    expansive survey of labor's upsurge during the 1930s, when the New Deal put
    a white, male version of industrial democracy at the heart of U.S. political
    culture. He debunks the myth of a postwar "management-labor accord" by
    showing that there was (at most) a limited, unstable truce. Lichtenstein
    argues that the ideas that had once sustained solidarity and citizenship in
    the world of work underwent a radical transformation when the
    rights-centered social movements of the 1960s and 1970s captured the
    nation's moral imagination. The labor movement was therefore tragically
    unprepared for the years of Reagan and Clinton: although technological
    change and a new era of global economics battered the unions, their real
    failure was one of ideas and political will. Throughout, Lichtenstein argues
    that labor's most important function, in theory if not always in practice,
    has been the vitalization of a democratic ethos, at work and in the larger
    society. To the extent that the unions fuse their purpose with that impulse,
    they can once again become central to the fate of the republic. State of the
    Union is an incisive history that tells the story of one of America's
    defining aspirations. This edition includes a new preface in which
    Lichtenstein engages with many of those who have offered commentary on State
    of the Union and evaluates the historical literature that has emerged in the
    decade since the book's initial publication. He also brings his narrative
    into the current moment with a final chapter, "Obama's America: Liberalism
    without Unions.?

    Unequal Gains offers a radically new understanding of the economic evolution
    of the United States, providing a complete picture of the uneven progress of
    America from colonial times to today.While other economic historians base
    their accounts on American wealth, Peter Lindert and Jeffrey Williamson
    focus instead on income―and the result is a bold reassessment of the
    American economic experience. America has been exceptional in its rising
    inequality after an egalitarian start, but not in its long-run
    growth.America had already achieved world income leadership by 1700, not
    just in the twentieth century as is commonly thought. Long before
    independence, American colonists enjoyed higher living standards than
    Britain―and America's income advantage today is no greater than it was three
    hundred years ago. But that advantage was lost during the Revolution, lost
    again during the Civil War, and lost a third time during the Great
    Depression, though it was regained after each crisis. In addition, Lindert
    and Williamson show how income inequality among Americans rose steeply in
    two great waves―from 1774 to 1860 and from the 1970s to today―rising more
    than in any other wealthy nation in the world. Unequal Gains also
    demonstrates how the widening income gaps have always touched every social
    group, from the richest to the poorest. The book sheds critical light on the
    forces that shaped American income history, and situates that history in a
    broad global context.Economic writing at its most stimulating, Unequal Gains
    provides a vitally needed perspective on who has benefited most from
    American growth, and why.

    The seven decades framed by the Great Railway Strike of 1877 and
    institutionalization of organized labor in the wake of World War II
    constituted a unique period of US labor relations, one that labor historians
    have identified as the most violent and bloody of any Western industrialized
    nation. Despite long-standing scholarly interest in the issues of
    labor-management conflict, however, important questions regarding the causes
    of extreme labor-management violence within the United States have never
    been adequately addressed. In this paper, I utilize a recently compiled and
    unique data set of American strike fatalities to statistically model the
    causes of extreme strike violence in the United States. The time-series
    evidence suggests that picket-line violence increased in association with
    (1) the struggle for and against unionization and (2) economic desperation
    associated with tightening labor markets. The results also both depict the
    stultifying effect of massacres and suggest that state support for labor’s
    right to organize tended to decrease the likelihood of violence and vice
    versa. This paper not only thus provides fresh insights into classic
    questions, but also offers a basis for both transhistorical and
    international comparison.

    In this chapter I will discuss topics and questions important to address in
    the task of charting the structure of social movement culture in terms of
    degree or extent. The phrase “charting the structure” is the earmark of what
    I will discuss—and therefore of what I will not discuss. As usefully mapped
    by Wuthnow and Witten, sociological studies of culture vary along the two
    major dimensions of (1) conceiving culture as an “implicit feature of social
    life” as opposed to viewing it as an “explicit social construction” and (2)
    focus on “social contexts in which culture is produced” (i.e.,

  abstract: >-
    When jobs can move anywhere in the world, bosses have no incentive to
    protect either their workers or the environment. Work moves seamlessly
    across national boundaries, yet the laws that protect us from rapacious
    behavior remain tied to national governments. This situation creates an
    all-too-familiar “race to the bottom,” where profit is generated on the
    backs of workers and at the cost of toxic pollution. In Out of Sight, Erik
    Loomis—a historian of both the labor and environmental movements—follows the
    thread that runs from the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire in New York in
    1911 to the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory building outside of Dhaka,
    Bangladesh, in 2013. The truth is that our systems of industrial production
    today are just as dirty and abusive as they were during the depths of the
    industrial revolution and the Gilded Age, but the ugly side of manufacturing
    is now hidden in faraway places where workers are most vulnerable. Today,
    American capitalists threaten that any environmental regulations will drive
    up the cost of production and force them to relocate our jobs to a country
    where they don’t face such laws and can re-create their toxic work
    conditions. It wasn’t always like this. In his insightful book, Loomis shows
    that the great environmental victories of twentieth-century America—the
    Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the EPA—were actually union victories.
    This history is a call to action: when we fight for our planet, we fight for
    our own dignity as workers and citizens.

    The battles to protect ancient forests and spotted owls in the Northwest
    splashed across the evening news in the 1980s and early 1990s. Empire of
    Timber re-examines this history to demonstrate that workers used their
    unions to fight for a healthy workplace environment and sustainable logging
    practices that would allow themselves and future generations the chance to
    both work and play in the forests. Examining labor organizations from the
    Industrial Workers of the World in the 1910s to unions in the 1980s, Empire
    of Timber shows that conventional narratives of workers opposing
    environmental protection are far too simplistic and often ignore the long
    histories of natural resource industry workers attempting to protect their
    health and their futures from the impact of industrial logging. Today, when
    workers fear that environmental restrictions threaten their jobs, learning
    the history of alliances between unions and environmentalists can build
    those conversations in the present.

    These Times "Entertaining, tough-minded, strenuously argued."—The Nation A
    thrilling and timely account of ten moments in history when labor challenged
    the very nature of power in America, by the author called “a brilliant
    historian” by The Progressive magazine Powerful and accessible, A History of
    America in Ten Strikes challenges all of our contemporary assumptions around
    labor, unions, and American workers. In this brilliant book, labor historian
    Erik Loomis recounts ten critical workers’ strikes in American labor history
    that everyone needs to know about (and then provides an annotated list of
    the 150 most important moments in American labor history in the appendix).
    From the Lowell Mill Girls strike in the 1830s to Justice for Janitors in
    1990, these labor uprisings do not just reflect the times in which they
    occurred, but speak directly to the present moment. For example, we often
    think that Lincoln ended slavery by proclaiming the slaves emancipated, but
    Loomis shows that they freed themselves during the Civil War by simply
    withdrawing their labor. He shows how the hopes and aspirations of a
    generation were made into demands at a GM plant in Lordstown in 1972. And he
    takes us to the forests of the Pacific Northwest in the early nineteenth
    century where the radical organizers known as the Wobblies made their
    biggest inroads against the power of bosses. But there were also moments
    when the movement was crushed by corporations and the government; Loomis
    helps us understand the present perilous condition of American workers and
    draws lessons from both the victories and defeats of the past. In
    crystalline narratives, labor historian Erik Loomis lifts the curtain on
    workers’ struggles, giving us a fresh perspective on American history from
    the boots up. Strikes include: Lowell Mill Girls Strike (Massachusetts,
    1830–40) Slaves on Strike (The Confederacy, 1861–65) The Eight-Hour Day
    Strikes (Chicago, 1886) The Anthracite Strike (Pennsylvania, 1902) The Bread
    and Roses Strike (Massachusetts, 1912) The Flint Sit-Down Strike (Michigan,
    1937) The Oakland General Strike (California, 1946) Lordstown (Ohio, 1972)
    Air Traffic Controllers (1981) Justice for Janitors (Los Angeles, 1990)

    This book critically examines Pierre Bourdieu's theory of the state by
    assessing its theoretical and empirical value. Steven Loyal expertly
    situates Bourdieu's work within the context of both classical and modern
    theories of the state, providing a comprehensive frame of reference.
    Finally, Loyal discusses Bourdieu's theoretical limitations and projects how
    his theory of the state might be utilized in the future.

A powerful organization model called “solidarity unionism” is explained, showing how the labor force can avoid the pitfalls of the legal system and utilize direct action to win fair rights. The new edition includes new cases governing fundamental labor rights\_and can be used not only by union workers, but can serve as a guerrilla legal handbook for any employee in this unstable economy."

  abstract: >-
    Critical reading for all who care about the future of labor, Solidarity
    Unionism draws deeply on Staughton Lynd’s experiences as a labor lawyer and
    activist in Youngstown, Ohio, and on his profound understanding of the
    history of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The book helps us
    begin to put not only movement, but also vision, back into the labor
    movement. There is a blossoming of rank-and-file worker organizations
    throughout the world that are countering rapacious capitalists and labor
    leaders who think they know more about work and struggle than their own
    members. To secure the gains of solidarity unions, Lynd has proposed
    parallel bodies of workers who share the principles of rank-and-file
    solidarity and can coordinate the activities of local workers’ assemblies.
    Detailed and inspiring examples include experiments in workers’
    self-organization across industries in steel-producing Youngstown, as well
    as horizontal networks of solidarity formed in a variety of U.S. cities and
    successful direct actions overseas. This book is not a prescription but
    reveals the lived experience of working people continuously taking risks for
    the common good.

    Simulation is one of the major applications of the web in entertainment and
    training, but has so far received little attention from HE and FE. It is
    becoming increasingly clear that simulations can be used for educational
    purposes, but how can they be used most effectively with students? How do
    they affect other areas of the legal curriculum? Can all professions use
    them equally effectively, and if so under which conditions? These and other
    questions are at centre of a two-year funded project, Transactional Learning
    Environment (TLE) 2.0, which sets out to create an environment, use it
    within variety of disciplines and sub-areas within law, and evaluate the
    results. This article describes the context of the project, sets out the
    ambitions of the project, and analyses the challenges facing it. It also
    sets the project within a larger technological context, and argues that such
    projects are essential not only for the future of legal education but for
    most professional disciplines in higher education.

    This second volume of Michael Mann's analytical history of social power
    deals with power relations between the Industrial Revolution and the First
    World War, focusing on France, Great Britain, Hapsburg Austria,
    Prussia/Germany and the United States. Based on considerable empirical
    research it provides original theories of the rise of nations and
    nationalism, of class conflict, of the modern state and of modern
    militarism. While not afraid to generalize, it also stresses social and
    historical complexity. The author sees human society as "a patterned mess"
    and attempts to provide a sociological theory appropriate to this. This
    theory culminates in the final chapter, an original explanation of the
    causes of the First World War.

    On April 6, 2018, the Trump administration announced a “zero tolerance”
    policy for individuals who crossed the U.S. border illegally. As part of
    this policy, the administration prosecuted parents with minor children for
    unlawful entry; previous administrations generally placed families in civil
    removal proceedings. Since U.S. law does not allow children to be held in
    immigration detention facilities pending their parents’ prosecution, the new
    policy caused thousands of children to be separated from their parents.
    Hundreds of families have yet to be reunited.

  abstract: "A revolutionary new argument from eminent Yale Law professor Daniel Markovits attacking the false promise of meritocracy\_It is an axiom of American life that advantage should be earned through ability and effort. Even as the country divides itself at every turn, the meritocratic ideal – that social and economic rewards should follow achievement rather than breeding – reigns supreme.\_ Both Democrats and Republicans insistently repeat meritocratic notions. Meritocracy cuts to the heart of who we are. It sustains the American dream. \_ But what if, both up and down the social ladder, meritocracy is a sham? Today, meritocracy has become exactly what it was conceived to resist: a mechanism for the concentration and dynastic transmission of wealth and privilege across generations. Upward mobility has become a fantasy, and the embattled middle classes are now more likely to sink into the working poor than to rise into the professional elite. At the same time, meritocracy now ensnares even those who manage to claw their way to the top, requiring rich adults to work with crushing intensity, exploiting their expensive educations in order to extract a return. All this is not the result of deviations or retreats from meritocracy but rather stems directly from meritocracy’s successes. \_ This is the radical argument that\_Daniel Markovits prosecutes with rare force. Markovits is well placed to expose the sham of meritocracy. Having spent his life at elite universities, he knows from the inside the corrosive system we are trapped within. Markovits also knows that, if we understand that meritocratic inequality produces near-universal harm, we can cure it. When The Meritocracy Trap reveals the inner workings of the meritocratic machine, it also illuminates the first steps outward, towards a new world that might once again afford dignity and prosperity to the American people."

  abstract: >-
    By early April 1914, Colorado Governor Elias Ammons thought the violence in
    his state’s strike-bound southern coal district had eased enough that he
    could begin withdrawing the Colorado National Guard, deployed six months
    earlier as military occupiers. But Ammons misread the signals, and on April
    20, 1914, a full-scale battle erupted between the remaining militiamen and
    armed strikers living in a tent colony at the small railroad town of Ludlow.
    Eight men were killed in the fighting, which culminated in the burning of
    the colony. The next day, the bodies of two women and eleven children were
    found suffocated in a below-ground shelter. The “Ludlow Massacre,” as it
    quickly became known, launched a national call-to-arms for union supporters
    to join a ten-day guerrilla war along more than two hundred miles of the
    eastern Rockies. The convulsion of arson and violence killed more than
    thirty people and didn’t end until President Woodrow Wilson sent in the U.S.
    Army. Overall at least seventy-five men, women, and children were killed in
    seven months, likely the nation’s deadliest labor struggle.In Blood Passion,
    journalist Scott Martelle explores this little-noted tale of political
    corruption and repression and immigrants’ struggles against dominant social
    codes of race, ethnicity, and class. More than a simple labor dispute, the
    events surrounding Ludlow embraced some of the most volatile social
    movements of the early twentieth century, pitting labor activists,
    socialists, and anarchists against the era’s powerful business class,
    including John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and helped give rise to the modern twins
    of corporate public relations and political “spin.” But at its heart, Blood
    Passion is the dramatic story of small lives merging into a movement for
    change and of the human struggle for freedom and dignity.

Living in exile in England, where this work was largely written, Marx drew on a wide-ranging knowledge of its society to support his analysis and create fresh insights. Arguing that capitalism would cause an ever-increasing division in wealth and welfare, he predicted its abolition and replacement by a system with common ownership of the means of production.\_Capital\_rapidly acquired readership among the leaders of social democratic parties, particularly in Russia in Germany, and ultimately throughout the world, to become a work described by Marx friend and collaborator Friedrich Engels as “the Bible of the working class.”For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

    Written during the winter of 1857-8, the Grundrisse was considered by Marx
    to be the first scientific elaboration of communist theory. A collection of
    seven notebooks on capital and money, it both develops the arguments
    outlined in the Communist Manifesto (1848) and explores the themes and
    theses that were to dominate his great later work Capital. Here, for the
    first time, Marx set out his own version of Hegel's dialectics and developed
    his mature views on labour, surplus value and profit, offering many fresh
    insights into alienation, automation and the dangers of capitalist society.
    Yet while the theories in Grundrisse make it a vital precursor to Capital,
    it also provides invaluable descriptions of Marx's wider-ranging philosophy,
    making it a unique insight into his beliefs and hopes for the foundation of
    a communist state.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading

    The third volume of a political treatise that changed the worldUnfinished at
    the time of Marx’s death in 1883 and first published with a preface by
    Frederick Engels in 1894, the third volume of Capital strives to combine the
    theories and concepts of the two previous volumes in order to prove
    conclusively that capitalism is inherently unworkable as a permanent system
    for society. Here, Marx controversially asserts that—regardless of the
    efforts of individual capitalists, public authorities or even generous
    philanthropists—any market economy is inevitably doomed to endure a series
    of worsening, explosive crises leading finally to complete collapse. But he
    also offers an inspirational and compelling prediction; that the end of
    capitalism will culminate in the birth of a far greater form of society.For

- id: McAdam2001
  abstract: >-
    Dissatisfied with the compartmentalization of studies concerning strikes,
    wars, revolutions, social movements, and other forms of political struggle,
    McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly identify causal mechanisms and processes that
    recur across a wide range of contentious politics. Critical of the static,
    single-actor models (including their own) that have prevailed in the field,
    they shift the focus of analysis to dynamic interaction. Doubtful that
    large, complex series of events such as revolutions and social movements
    conform to general laws, they break events into smaller episodes, then
    identify recurrent mechanisms and proceses within them. Dynamics of
    Contention examines and compares eighteen contentious episodes drawn from
    many different parts of the world since the French Revolution, probing them
    for consequential and widely applicable mechanisms, for example, brokerage,
    category formation, and elite defection. The episodes range from
    nineteenth-century nationalist movements to contemporary Muslim-Hindu
    conflict to the Tiananmen crisis of 1989 to disintegration of the Soviet
    Union. The authors spell out the implications of their approach for
    explanation of revolutions, nationalism, and democratization, then lay out a
    more general program for study of contentious episodes wherever and whenever
    they occur.

  abstract: >-
    From longtime labor organizer Jane McAlevey, a vital call-to-arms in favor
    of unions, a key force capable of defending our democracyFor decades,
    racism, corporate greed, and a skewed political system have been eating away
    at the social and political fabric of the United States. Yet as McAlevey
    reminds us, there is one weapon whose effectiveness has been proven
    repeatedly throughout U.S. history: unions.In A Collective Bargain, longtime
    labor organizer, environmental activist, and political campaigner Jane
    McAlevey makes the case that unions are a key institution capable of taking
    effective action against today’s super-rich corporate class. Since the
    1930s, when unions flourished under New Deal protections, corporations have
    waged a stealthy and ruthless war against the labor movement. And they’ve
    been winning.Until today. Because, as McAlevey shows, unions are making a
    comeback. Want to reverse the nation’s mounting wealth gap? Put an end to
    sexual harassment in the workplace? End racial disparities on the job?
    Negotiate climate justice? Bring back unions. As McAlevey travels from
    Pennsylvania hospitals, where nurses are building a new kind of
    patient-centered unionism, to Silicon Valley, where tech workers have turned
    to old-fashioned collective action, to the battle being waged by America’s
    teachers, readers have a ringside seat at the struggles that will shape our

  abstract: >-
    The crisis of the progressive movement is so evident that nothing less than
    a fundamental rethinking of its basic assumptions is required. Today's
    progressives now work for professional organizations more comfortable with
    the inside game in Washington DC (and capitols throughout the West), where
    they are outmatched and outspent by corporate interests. Labor unions now
    focus on the narrowest possible understanding of the interests of their
    members, and membership continues to decline in lockstep with the narrowing
    of their goals. Meanwhile, promising movements like Occupy Wall Street and
    Black Lives Matter lack sufficient power to accomplish meaningful change.
    Why do progressives in the United States keep losing on so many issues? In
    No Shortcuts, Jane McAlevey argues that progressives can win, but lack the
    organized power to enact significant change, to outlast their bosses in
    labor fights, and to hold elected leaders accountable. Drawing upon her
    experience as a scholar and longtime organizer in the student,
    environmental, and labor movements, McAlevey examines cases from labor
    unions and social movements to pinpoint the factors that helped them succeed
    - or fail - to accomplish their intended goals. McAlevey makes a compelling
    case that the great social movements of previous eras gained their power
    from mass organizing, a strategy today's progressives have mostly abandoned
    in favor of shallow mobilization or advocacy. She ultimately concludes that,
    in order to win, progressive movements need strong unions built from
    bottom-up organizing strategies that place the power for change in the hands
    of workers and ordinary people at the community level. Beyond the concrete
    examples in this book, McAlevey's arguments have direct implications for
    anyone involved in organizing for social change. Much more than cogent
    analysis, No Shortcuts explains exactly how progressives can go about
    rebuilding powerful movements at work, in our communities, and at the ballot
    box.

  abstract: >-
    In 1995, in the first contested election in the history of the AFL-CIO, John
    Sweeney won the presidency of the nation’s largest labor federation,
    promising renewal and resurgence. Today, less than 7 percent of American
    private-sector workers belong to a union, the lowest percentage since the
    beginning of the twentieth century, and public employee collective
    bargaining has been dealt devastating blows in Wisconsin and elsewhere. What
    happened?Jane McAlevey is famous—and notorious—in the American labor
    movement as the hard-charging organizer who racked up a string of victories
    at a time when union leaders said winning wasn’t possible. Then she was
    bounced from the movement, a victim of the high-level internecine warfare
    that has torn apart organized labor. In this engrossing and funny
    narrative—that reflects the personality of its charismatic, wisecracking
    author—McAlevey tells the story of a number of dramatic organizing and
    contract victories, and the unconventional strategies that helped achieve
    them.Raising Expectations (and Raising Hell) argues that labor can be
    revived, but only if the movement acknowledges its mistakes and fully
    commits to deep organizing, participatory education, militancy, and an
    approach to workers and their communities that more resembles the campaigns
    of the 1930s—in short, social movement unionism that involves raising
    workers’ expectations (while raising hell).

    Since passage of the Wagner Act in 1935, U. S. labor law has guaranteed
    workers the right to strike. Three years later, the same system of law
    assured the employer's right to continue production in spite of a strike.
    This paper explores how the Wagner Act and its subsequent developments have
    simultaneously empowered workers and constrained their collective capacity
    to exercise control over the workplace. Historical legal analysis of Wagner
    and its applications, interpretations, and amendments indicates that the law
    has diminished the effectiveness of the strike, reduced the likelihood of
    its occurrence, and limited its legitimate forms, all the while sustaining
    the right to strike. I argue that by this careful balance of empowerment and
    constraint, the state has found the means of reconciling the structural
    constraints of capitalism--the imperatives of accumulation--with those of
    democracy--the demands of legitimacy.

  abstract: >-
    This article examines how changing legal institutions have structured
    workers' collective decision to strike. It uses both qualitative
    legal-historical analysis and quantitative time-series regression to examine
    how major changes in labor law in the late 1930s altered workers'
    willingness and opportunity to strike. Previous research has assumed that
    important change in workplace relations occurred in the late 1940s. The
    present work relocates that change to the late 1930s with a number of
    important implications. In particular, this study shows that the federal
    government, both its legislative and judicial branches, was an important
    shaper of workplace relations. State legal policy regulating labor militancy
    prior to the late 1930s is labeled "repressive intervention" while the
    state's intervention after the New Deal is defined as "integrative
    prevention."

  abstract: >-
    Traditional approaches to understanding the emergence and mobilization of
    social movements focused primarily upon fluctuations in the hearts and minds
    of aggrieved individuals. Analysts of social movements inspired by the
    accelerated founding rates of more or less bureaucratically organized groups
    of citizens in the 1960s—joining early risers in the organizational field
    some of which, such as the National Association for the Advancement of
    Colored People (NAACP), had emerged in the nineteenth century—began to focus
    more directly upon the central mediating role that social movement
    organizations (SMOs) play in mobilizing social movement activity. Zald and
    Ash (1966) first systematically deployed the concept in their classic paper
    that effectively challenged the universality of Roberto Michels' (1949)
    “iron law of oligarchy.” Denotatively bounding the SMO, their analyses
    referenced civil rights movement organizations of the 1960s, including the
    Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) and the NAACP, as well as the American
    Communist Party and the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The
    concept was later more clearly specified by McCarthy and Zald (1973: 1218):
    “A social movement organization (SMO) is a complex, or formal organization
    which identifies its preferences with a social movement or a
    counter-movement and attempts to implement those goals.” In subsequent
    years, the term and its acronym, SMO, have come into widespread use as
    scholars have sought to understand patterns of SMO emergence, variations in
    SMO structure, and functioning.

  abstract: >-
    Since World War I, says Joseph McCartin, the central problem of American
    labor relations has been the struggle among workers, managers, and state
    officials to reconcile democracy and authority in the workplace. In his
    comprehensive look at labor issues during the decade of the Great War,
    McCartin explores the political, economic, and social forces that gave rise
    to this conflict and shows how rising labor militancy and the sudden erosion
    of managerial control in wartime workplaces combined to create an industrial
    crisis. The search for a resolution to this crisis led to the formation of
    an influential coalition of labor Democrats, AFL unionists, and Progressive
    activists on the eve of U.S. entry into the war. Though the coalition's
    efforts in pursuit of industrial democracy were eventually frustrated by
    powerful forces in business and government and by internal rifts within the
    movement itself, McCartin shows how the shared quest helped cement the ties
    between unionists and the Democratic Party that would subsequently shape
    much New Deal legislation and would continue to influence the course of
    American political and labor history to the present day.

    Discussions of legal practice and dispute resolution are often dominated—and

    popular and academic literatures are preoccupied with contrasts between
    formal and informal processes, competitive and cooperative attorney styles,
    clients’ rights and needs, lawyer and client control of decisionmaking, and
    so on. Whatever utility it may have for framing rhetorical questions about
    legal reform, such binary thinking does not accord with the more complex
    realities of legal practice, which are often located not at one end or
    another of such polarities but in the dynamic interplay between

    This article studies law in action as it relates to organized lobster
    poaching in Canada. It examines the distinct pattern of relationships that
    constitutes poaching as a business enterprise and analyzes how "living law"
    operates as an ironic facilitative form for that which it tries to control.
    We argue that business poachers evade, avoid, and neutralize fishery laws
    and regulations by creatively using and manipulating the legal boundaries
    and organizational resources at their disposal. In effect, the law is an
    enabling structure for blue water illegality. We analyze business poaching
    activities as a type of workplace crime, and we account for regulatory
    failure in the lobster fishery.

    Ordinary Americans often bring family and neighborhood problems to court,
    seeking justice or revenge. The litigants in these local squabbles encounter
    law at its boundaries in the corridors of busy city courthouses, in the
    offices of court clerks, and in the church parlors used by mediation
    programs. Getting Justice and Getting Even concerns the legal consciousness
    of working class Americans and their experiences with court and mediation.
    Following cases into and through the courts, Sally Engle Merry provides an
    ethnographic study of local law and of the people who use it in a New
    England city. The litigants, primarily white, native-born, and working
    class, go to court because as part of mainstream America they feel entitled
    to use its legal system. Although neither powerful nor highly educated, they
    expect the law’s support when they face intolerable infringements of their
    rights, privacy, and safety. Yet as personal problems enter the legal system
    and move through mediation sessions, clerk’s hearings, and prosecutor’s
    conferences, the citizen plaintiff rapidly loses control of the process.
    Court officials and mediators interpret and characterize the meaning of
    these experiences, reframing and categorizing them in different discourses.
    Some plaintiffs yield to these interpretations, but others resist,
    struggling to assert their own version of the problem. Ultimately, Merry
    exposes the paradox of legal entitlement. While going to court allows an
    individual to dominate domestic relationships, the litigant must
    increasingly yield control of the situation to the court that supplies that
    power.

    I hope to indicate a way in which social science can overcome (indeed, has
    been overcoming) analytic dichotomies that have plagued attempts to
    understand human societies in general, and the role of law in particular.
    [T]he concept of social construction can bring together analysis of idea and
    action, meaning and material life, constraint and creativity, power and
    resistance, stasis and change—and can do so through a form of analysis that
    combines empirical and critical work. Another interesting facet of this
    approach is its synthesis of a moderate skepticism regarding the fixed or
    natural character of categories—a skepticism that

  abstract: >-
    It has been over two decades since the United States Supreme Court handed
    down the landmark Yeshiva decision. In that case, the faculty in a private
    university was determined to be "managerial" and not entitled to collective
    bargaining rights and other protections under federal labor law. Despite
    Yeshiva's broad and significant impact in deterring faculty organizing at
    private colleges and universities, successful union organizing drives,
    though few, have been growing more frequent on campuses across the United
    States. In this paper, we examine the Yeshiva case and analyze its
    implications for private and public universities, including current trends
    such as the increased use of contingent faculty and distance learning. We
    also examine successful organizing efforts and discuss their implications
    for organized labor.

    Movement-countermovement interaction is an ongoing feature of contemporary
    social movements and, indeed, of contemporary politics. Yet the interplay of
    contending movements is understudied and undertheorized. This article begins
    to remedy this deficit by arguing that new work on political opportunity
    structure provides important insights and significant theoretical leverage
    for this study. Through a review of the literatures on countermovements and
    political opportunity, this article argues that this interaction increases
    when states enable but do not satisfy challengers. This article presents a
    general framework of theoretical propositions for understanding the
    interplay of movements and their opponents to animate and guide subsequent
    research.

  abstract: "Who is the richest person in the world, ever? Does where you were born affect how much money you’ll earn over a lifetime? How would we know? Why—beyond the idle curiosity—do these questions even matter? In The Haves and the Have-Nots, Branko Milanovic, one of the world’s leading experts on wealth, poverty, and the gap that separates them, explains these and other mysteries of how wealth is unevenly spread throughout our world, now and through time.\_Milanovic uses history, literature and stories straight out of today’s newspapers, to discuss one of the major divisions in our social lives: between the haves and the have-nots. He reveals just how rich Elizabeth Bennet’s suitor Mr. Darcy really was; how much Anna Karenina gained by falling in love; how wealthy ancient Romans compare to today’s super-rich; where in Kenyan income distribution was Obama’s grandfather; how we should think about Marxism in a modern world; and how location where one is born determines his wealth. He goes beyond mere entertainment to explain why inequality matters, how it damages our economics prospects, and how it can threaten the foundations of the social order that we take for granted.\_ Bold, engaging, and illuminating, The Haves and the Have-Nots teaches us not only how to think about inequality, but why we should."

  abstract: >-
    A provocative account of capitalism’s rise to global dominance and, as
    different models of capitalism vie for world leadership, a look into what
    the future may hold.We are all capitalists now. For the first time in human
    history, the globe is dominated by one economic system. In Capitalism,
    Alone, leading economist Branko Milanovic explains the reasons for this
    decisive historical shift since the days of feudalism and, later, communism.
    Surveying the varieties of capitalism, he asks: What are the prospects for a
    fairer world now that capitalism is the only game in town? His conclusions
    are sobering, but not fatalistic. Capitalism gets much wrong, but also much
    right―and it is not going anywhere. Our task is to improve it.Milanovic
    argues that capitalism has triumphed because it works. It delivers
    prosperity and gratifies human desires for autonomy. But it comes with a
    moral price, pushing us to treat material success as the ultimate goal. And
    it offers no guarantee of stability. In the West, liberal capitalism creaks
    under the strains of inequality and capitalist excess. That model now fights
    for hearts and minds with political capitalism, exemplified by China, which
    many claim is more efficient, but which is more vulnerable to corruption
    and, when growth is slow, social unrest. As for the economic problems of the
    Global South, Milanovic offers a creative, if controversial, plan for
    large-scale migration. Looking to the future, he dismisses prophets who
    proclaim some single outcome to be inevitable, whether worldwide prosperity
    or robot-driven mass unemployment. Capitalism is a risky system. But it is a
    human system. Our choices, and how clearly we see them, will determine how
    it serves us.

    Presenting a sustained and concrete challenge to the current political
    consensus, this reference identifies the radical alternative of adopting
    socialism as the key issue facing civilization and the crucial condition of
    making substantial progress. Demonstrating that capitalist control of the
    state was so comprehensive that partial reforms were impossible, this
    reference attempts to explain how society has managed to evade socialism,
    exploring how its claims have failed to persuade many intellectuals and the
    potential benefactors of an alternative order. Reviewing the influence of
    economic elites and the dominant class, this study also probes the state’s
    claims to legitimacy, defines the purpose and role of governments, and
    analyzes the concepts of reform and repression. Depicting how the state
    reemerged from behind the mystifications of the political system and its
    behavior to become the central theme of political studies, this radical and
    philosophical investigation combines a political appeal with thorough,
    detailed scholarship. A discussion of servants of the state and the concept
    of imperfect competition are also included.

    "In order to recruit new members on a scale that would be required to
    significantly rebuild union power, unions must fundamentally alter their
    internal organizational practices. This means creating more organizer
    positions on the staff; developing programs to teach current members how to
    handle the tasks involved in resolving shop-floor grievances; and building
    programs that train members to participate fully in the work of external
    organizing. Such a reorientation entails redefining the very meaning of
    union membership from a relatively passive stance toward one of continuous
    active engagement."―from the Introduction In Rebuilding Labor Ruth Milkman
    and Kim Voss bring together established researchers and a new generation of
    labor scholars to assess the current state of labor organizing and its
    relationship to union revitalization. Throughout this collection, the focus
    is on the formidable challenges unions face today and on how they may be
    overcome. Rebuilding Labor begins with a comprehensive overview of recent
    union organizing in the United States; goes on to present a series of richly
    detailed case studies of such topics as union leadership, organizer
    recruitment and retention, union democracy, and the dynamics of
    anti-unionism among rank-and-file workers; and concludes with a quantitative
    chapter on the relationship between union victories and establishment
    survival. This interdisciplinary collection of original scholarship on New
    Labor offers a window into an otherwise invisible emergent social movement.

    First published in 1956, The Power Elite stands as a contemporary classic of
    social science and social criticism. C. Wright Mills examines and critiques
    the organization of power in the United States, calling attention to three
    firmly interlocked prongs of power: the military, corporate, and political
    elite. The Power Elite can be read as a good account of what was taking
    place in America at the time it was written, but its underlying question of
    whether America is as democratic in practice as it is in theory continues to
    matter very much today.What The Power Elite informed readers of in 1956 was
    how much the organization of power in America had changed during their
    lifetimes, and Alan Wolfe's astute afterword to this new edition brings us
    up to date, illustrating how much more has changed since then. Wolfe sorts
    out what is helpful in Mills' book and which of his predictions have not
    come to bear, laying out the radical changes in American capitalism, from
    intense global competition and the collapse of communism to rapid
    technological transformations and ever changing consumer tastes. The Power
    Elite has stimulated generations of readers to think about the kind of
    society they have and the kind of society they might want, and deserves to
    be read by every new generation.

    By studying the ways in which American industrial workers mobilized
    concerted action in their own interest, the author focuses on the workplace
    itself, examining the codes of conduct developed by different types of
    workers and the connections between their activity at work and their
    national origins and neighborhood life. David Montgomery, Farnam Professor
    of History at Yale University since 1979, is the author of Worker's Control

- id: Moore1993
  abstract: >-
    Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy is a comparative survey of some
    of what Moore considers the major/most indicative world economies as they
    evolved out of pre-modern political systems into industrialism. As the title
    suggests, Moore is not ultimately concerned with explaining economic
    development so much as exploring why modes of development produced different
    political forms that managed the transition to industrialism and
    modernization. Why did one society modernize into a "relatively free,"
    democratic society (by which Moore means England) while others metamorphosed
    into fascist or communist states? His core thesis is that in each country,
    the relationship between the landlord class and the peasants was a primary
    influence on the ultimate form of government the society arrived at upon
    arrival in its modern age.

    For Walter Benjamin, there is a complementary relationship of art and
    philosophy. Philosophy exercises a persistence of discourse against any
    ostensibly concluded gesture of an artwork. Philosophy is not a fragment to
    be treated as inviolably apart; nor can it treat anything else – including
    the artwork – as inviolably apart. There is no final gesture. The gestural
    element remains, nonetheless, integral to philosophy; the gestural element
    openly performs beyond the discursive – beyond the denotative (and any
    connoted denotations). In the encounter with artworks, philosophy is kept
    attentive to the resistance of particularity to discursive rendering. Such
    unyielding is

    After President Trump’s election, BREXIT and the widespread rise of
    far-Right political parties, much public discussion has intensely focused on
    populism and authoritarianism. In the middle of the twentieth century,
    members of the early Frankfurt School prolifically studied and theorized
    fascism and anti-Semitism in Germany and the United States. In this volume,
    leading European and American scholars apply insights from the early
    Frankfurt School to present-day authoritarian populism, including the Trump
    phenomenon and related developments across the globe. Chapters are arranged
    into three sections exploring different aspects of the topic: theories,
    historical foundations, and manifestations via social media. Contributions
    examine the vital political, psychological and anthropological theories of
    early Frankfurt School thinkers, and how their insights could be applied now
    amidst the insecurities and confusions of twenty-first century life. The
    many theorists considered include Adorno, Fromm, Löwenthal and Marcuse,
    alongside analysis of Austrian Facebook pages and Trump’s tweets and
    operatic media drama. This book is a major contribution towards deeper
    understanding of populism’s resurgence in the age of digital capitalism.

    This essay delineates three responses to antisemitism by social scientists
    of Jewish descent: Georg Simmel (1858–1918), one of the founders of academic
    sociology; Franz Boas (1858–1942), the founder of American cultural
    anthropology; and Arthur Ruppin (1876–1943), the founder of Jewish sociology
    and demography. Simmel and Boas were both staunch supporters of Jewish
    assimilation; Ruppin, a prominent Zionist leader, was an opponent of
    assimilation. All three thinkers recognized the reality of modern
    antisemitism and viewed it as a set of cognitive and social practices that
    were irreducible to Christian animosity toward Jews. Their responses to
    antisemitism diverge, though,

    This article challenges and refutes the conventional wisdom that the
    Taft-Hartley Act changed the basic policy of the National Labor Relations
    Act (NLRA or Act). It identifies two interrelated phenomena as factors
    primarily responsible for the longstanding inability of the National Labor
    Relations Board (NLRB or Board) to adequately protect employees in their
    right to unionize and engage in collective bargaining. One phenomenon is the
    historical revisionism that distorted perception of the Act's policy. The
    other is the repetitive abuse of the Board's appointment process. The
    article also demonstrates that the NLRB's failings resulted primarily from
    the agency's reluctance to vigorously enforce existing law and to utilize
    innovative measures currently available under the Act rather than from the
    Act's insufficiencies, despite the fact that the statute has many
    shortcomings. The article points out that although Taft-Hartley in its
    substantive content is a union-regulatory statute that severely reduced the
    power of unions in the collective bargaining process and in their
    relationship to their members, the Taft-Hartley Congress nevertheless
    reenacted—and even enhanced—the Wagner Act's basic policy of encouraging and
    protecting union organizing and collective bargaining. That unambiguous
    declaration of policy and retention of all of the original Wagner Act's
    pro-union and pro-collective-bargaining substantive provisions was the price
    that Taft-Hartley's sponsors had to pay to garner sufficient votes to
    override President Truman's anticipated veto. Yet, notwithstanding the
    textual clarity of that policy, its consistent legislative history, and its
    later reenactment with stronger language in the Landrum-Griffin Act,
    organized management and their political allies have deliberately
    disseminated false and revisionist de facto versions of that policy. Those
    versions assert that Taft-Hartley changed the Act's policy to emphasize
    employee free-choice— a concept allegedly based on Taft-Hartley's limited
    requirement that a union not "restrain or coerce" employees regarding their
    "right to refrain" from union activity—even though Congress expressly
    excluded that minor feature from each of its three declarations of national
    labor policy. The phenomenon of abuse of the appointment process was the
    practice by every Republican President of appointing a critical number of
    Board Members and General Counsels who were opposed to the NLRA's basic
    policy. This resulted in Boards that were highly successful in protecting
    employers from disruptive union economic power—such as secondary boycotts
    and economic strikes without permanent replacements—but were deliberately
    impotent in providing strong protection for employees in their right to join
    unions and engage in meaningful collective bargaining in accordance with the
    Act's underlying policy. The article recommends a corrective program of
    intensive truth-telling that might produce Labor Boards willing to use the
    broad and flexible text of the Act to accomplish effective enforcement.

    social conditions that have shaped the evolution of organized labor”
    (Library Journal), enlivened by numerous full-page illustrations throughout
    from the celebrated comics journalist Joe Sacco. In this fully updated new
    edition, authors Priscilla Murolo and A.B. Chitty have added a wealth of
    fresh analysis of labor’s role in American life, with new material on sex
    workers, disability issues, labor’s relation to the global justice movement
    and the immigrants’ rights movement, the 2005 split in the AFL-CIO and the
    movement civil wars that followed, and the crucial emergence of worker
    centers and their relationships to unions. With two entirely new
    chapters—one on global developments, from the movement of jobs offshore to
    the emergence of modern global union federations, and a second on the 2016
    election and unions’ relationships to Trump—From the Folks Who Brought You
    the Weekend will remain the standard, “comprehensive history of American
    labor” (The Washington Post).

    Marx notoriously claimed that Judaism was particularistic and must be
    sacrificed in the process ofuniversal human emancipation. In the past few
    decades, some Marxists have responded to Marx's alleged antisemitism and
    attempted to rethink his work in relation to Jewish identity by
    supplementing his theory with poststructuralist critiques of universality.
    However, such methods risk ontologizing both Jewish identity and universal
    emancipation, being blind to how their conditions change historically.
    Moishe Postone's rereading of Marx's work enables us to avoid the political
    pitfalls associated with both the violent teleology of the universal and the
    radical indeterminacy of the particular by historicizing them in relation to
    capitalism. This article brings Postone's work into dialogue with other
    Marxists and argues that he presents a Jewish, nonteleogical reading of
    Marx's theory of history, which is especially relevant for us today.

  abstract: >-
    Adjudicators and scholars have yet to work out the labor law implications of
    an emerging form of worker-advocacy organization—the worker center. Today,
    over 160 worker centers in the United States assist low-wage, often
    immigrant workers by providing legal and other services, advocating on their
    behalf through publicity and legislative campaigns, and organizing them to
    take action for economic and political change. While many worker centers
    seek to vindicate employment rights and may target employers, they generally
    avoid bargaining with employers. This Article explores how traditional labor
    laws, primarily the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and the Labor
    Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA), should apply to worker
    centers. While worker centers can use labor law's protections for any
    workers who qualify as statutory employees, it is less clear whether the
    law's restrictions on union activities—such as prohibitions on secondary
    boycotts and intensive reporting requirements, which apply to
    statutorily-defined "labor organizations"—should apply to worker centers.
    Whether a worker center should be considered a "labor organization" depends
    on its particular activities. The Article suggests a framework that analyzes
    worker center activity through three lenses: a traditional statutory
    analysis based on section 2(5) of the NLRA and section 2(5) case law, a
    contextual analysis based on the policies that animate different parts of
    the NLRA, and a purposive analysis that considers constitutional concerns in
    regulating associational activity that may merit First Amendment protection.
    The Article applies this three-tiered framework to four worker centers that
    exemplify different aspects of the worker center movement, in order to
    determine which worker center activities are most likely to confer "labor
    organization" status. Viewed through all three lenses, labor law regulation
    of most worker centers is unlikely, so long as the centers do not seek to
    directly bargain with employers over working conditions. Worker centers may
    also avoid becoming "labor organizations" if they limit any such bargaining
    to the settling of litigation arising from individual employment claims
    (such as wage and hour, discrimination, and workers' compensation claims).
    However, when worker centers seek to resolve workplace disputes by engaging
    in sustained back-and-forth dealings with the employer, as they may in some
    code-of-conduct campaigns, they run a risk of being brought under the
    purview of traditional labor law. The Article concludes by suggesting
    additional legal quandaries that may arise as worker centers grow, undertake
    partnerships with unions, and confront other areas of law in which the
    courts have accorded special protections to labor unions.

    An unprecedented account of social stratification within the US legal
    profession. How do race, class, gender, and law school status condition the
    career trajectories of lawyers? And how do professionals then navigate these
    parameters? The Making of Lawyers’ Careers provides an unprecedented account
    of the last two decades of the legal profession in the US, offering a
    data-backed look at the structure of the profession and the inequalities
    that early-career lawyers face across race, gender, and class distinctions.
    Starting in 2000, the authors collected over 10,000 survey responses from
    more than 5,000 lawyers, following these lawyers through the first twenty
    years of their careers. They also interviewed more than two hundred lawyers
    and drew insights from their individual stories, contextualizing data with
    theory and close attention to the features of a market-driven legal
    profession.  Their findings show that lawyers’ careers both reflect and
    reproduce inequalities within society writ large. They also reveal how
    individuals exercise agency despite these constraints.

    The legal consciousness of ordinary citizens concerning offensive public
    speech is a phenomenon whose legal status has been vigorously debated, but
    which has received little empirical analysis. Drawing on observations in
    public spaces in three northern California communities and in-depth
    interviews with 100 subjects recruited from these public locations, I
    analyze variation across race and gender groups in experiences with
    offensive public speech and attitudes about how such speech should be dealt
    with by law. Among these respondents, white women and people of color are
    far more likely than white men to report being the targets of offensive
    public speech. However, white women and people of color are not
    significantly more likely than white men to favor its legal regulation.
    Respondents generally oppose the legal regulation of offensive public
    speech, but they employ different discourses to explain why. Subjects' own
    words suggest four relatively distinct paradigms that emphasize the First
    Amendment, autonomy, impracticality, and distrust of authority. Members of
    different racial and gender groups tend to use different discourses. These
    differences suggest that the legal consciousness of ordinary citizens is not
    a unitary phenomenon, but must be situated in relation to particular types
    of laws, particular social hierarchies, and the experiences of different
    groups with the law.

    In this article I analyze the legal consciousness of ordinary citizens by
    examining how experiences with and legal attitudes toward offensive public
    speech vary by race, gender, and class. I find that white women and people
    of color experience dramatically higher levels of offensive public speech
    and that these experiences significantly affect their daily lives. Yet
    experiencing harms from offensive public speech does not translate into
    supporting its legal regulation. Subjects offer a variety of reasons to
    justify their opposition to the legal regulation of such speech. Members of
    different racial and gender groups articulate distinctive discourses about
    offensive public

    Continuing his groundbreaking analysis of economic structures, Douglass
    North develops an analytical framework for explaining the ways in which
    institutions and institutional change affect the performance of economies,
    both at a given time and over time. Institutions exist, he argues, due to
    the uncertainties involved in human interaction; they are the constraints
    devised to structure that interaction. Yet, institutions vary widely in
    their consequences for economic performance; some economies develop
    institutions that produce growth and development, while others develop
    institutions that produce stagnation. North first explores the nature of
    institutions and explains the role of transaction and production costs in
    their development. The second part of the book deals with institutional
    change. Institutions create the incentive structure in an economy, and
    organizations will be created to take advantage of the opportunities
    provided within a given institutional framework. North argues that the kinds
    of skills and knowledge fostered by the structure of an economy will shape
    the direction of change and gradually alter the institutional framework. He
    then explains how institutional development may lead to a path-dependent
    pattern of development. In the final part of the book, North explains the
    implications of this analysis for economic theory and economic history. He
    indicates how institutional analysis must be incorporated into neo-classical
    theory and explores the potential for the construction of a dynamic theory
    of long-term economic change. Douglass C. North is Director of the Center of
    Political Economy and Professor of Economics and History at Washington
    University in St. Louis. He is a past president of the Economic History
    Association and Western Economics Association and a Fellow, American Academy
    of Arts and Sciences. He has written over sixty articles for a variety of
    journals and is the author of The Rise of the Western World: A New Economic
    History (CUP, 1973, with R.P. Thomas) and Structure and Change in Economic
    History (Norton, 1981). Professor North is included in Great Economists

    Until the mid-twentieth century, the dominant perspective was that social
    categories of race reflect inherent biological differences. This supported a
    Eurocentric idea that there is a natural racial hierarchy that reflects each
    groups’ innate abilities. While this perspective has been discredited over
    the past few decades, bodies and phenotype continue to dominate how we
    understand race. Indeed, if there has been one constant throughout these
    shifting and contested understandings, it is the widespread and largely
    unquestioned belief that race is primarily a matter of visually obvious
    physical features.  This emphasis on the visual character of race can be

    This article examines the writings of Austrian parliamentarian,
    editorialist, and social theorist Otto Bauer concerning the Jews ofwestern,
    eastern, and central Europe. Though Bauer has been seen as a champion of the
    concepts of national and cultural autonomy in general, there is considerable
    scholarly confusion as to his views on whether the Jews did or could
    constitute a nation. Reconstructing Bauer's role as a Marxian theorist of
    nationalism in the historical context of the Habsburg Empire between the
    first Russian Revolution and World War I, I make a case for the multilayered
    sophistication of Bauer's concern with the central- and eastern-European
    question of nationalities, its relation to class struggle, and the place of
    the Jews in the dynamics of both. Bauer's analysis of the Jews as a nation
    without a state, his interest in a theory of Jewish cultural hybridity, and
    his concern with the precarity introduced with any scheme of state partition
    or redefinition are all specifically grounded in the unique circumstances of
    the late Habsburg Empire but came to be of much broader releva.nce to
    twentieth-century theorists because they speak to an age of universal
    vulnerability. Exploring the proposition that Bauer's concept of national
    identity always incorporated reflections on the "negative," exclusionary,
    and weaponized dimensions of identity and group belonging, I argue that
    Bauer's unique analyses of antisemitism and its relation to caste and class
    economies offer rich resources for reinterpreting the role of Jews alongside
    the problem of antisemitism in European history.

    This book develops an original theory of group and organizational behavior
    that cuts across disciplinary lines and illustrates the theory with
    empirical and historical studies of particular organizations. Applying
    economic analysis to the subjects of the political scientist, sociologist,
    and economist, Mancur Olson examines the extent to which the individuals
    that share a common interest find it in their individual interest to bear
    the costs of the organizational effort.The theory shows that most
    organizations produce what the economist calls “public goods”―goods or
    services that are available to every member, whether or not he has borne any
    of the costs of providing them. Economists have long understood that
    defense, law, and order were public goods that could not be marketed to
    individuals, and that taxation was necessary. They have not, however, taken
    account of the fact that private as well as governmental organizations
    produce public goods.The services the labor union provides for the worker it
    represents, or the benefits a lobby obtains for the group it represents, are
    public goods: they automatically go to every individual in the group,
    whether or not he helped bear the costs. It follows that, just as
    governments require compulsory taxation, many large private organizations
    require special (and sometimes coercive) devices to obtain the resources
    they need. This is not true of smaller organizations for, as this book
    shows, small and large organizations support themselves in entirely
    different ways. The theory indicates that, though small groups can act to
    further their interest much more easily than large ones, they will tend to
    devote too few resources to the satisfaction of their common interests, and
    that there is a surprising tendency for the “lesser” members of the small
    group to exploit the “greater” members by making them bear a
    disproportionate share of the burden of any group action.All of the theory
    in the book is in Chapter 1; the remaining chapters contain empirical and
    historical evidence of the theory’s relevance to labor unions, pressure
    groups, corporations, and Marxian class action.

    A Besere Velt, the Boston Worker’s Circle community chorus, performs for a
    modern audience the music of Yiddish-speaking Jewish partisans and ghetto
    resisters. Through active transmission and re-interpretation of partisan and
    ghetto songs, A Besere Velt invokes East-European Jewish tradition and
    creates a liminal space ripe with new possibility. In the process, the
    chorus gives these old songs life for contemporary Jews. The analysis
    situates the songs within the genre of Yiddish music and investigates
    through interviews ways that members build meaning through the performance
    of partisan music, the construction of Jewish space, and the promise of
    Jewish futures.

    We profile the lawyers that work at the largest 300 American law firms as of
    the Summer of 2008. We show how gender, years of experience, prestige of law
    school, and other qualities vary across lawyers of different rank and firms
    of different prestige. Geography is an important determinant of where
    lawyers work, with many going to undergraduate school and law school near
    where they ultimately practice. Geography is less important, however, at
    more prestigious firms and for graduates of higher ranked firms. We then go
    on to rank law firms based on the prestige of the law schools they attended
    and we rank law schools based on their success at placing lawyers at BigLaw
    firms. Chicago, Harvard, and Yale law schools are the clear leaders in
    placing graduates at BigLaw firms. We provide important caveats about these
    rankings.

    The authors study the sources of match-specific value at large U.S. law
    firms by analyzing how graduates of law schools group into law firms. They
    measure the degree to which lawyers from certain schools concentrate within
    certain firms and then analyze how this agglomeration can be explained by
    ?natural advantage?? factors (such as geographic proximity) and by
    productive complementarities across graduates of a given school. Large law
    firms tend to hire from a select group of law schools, and individual
    offices within these firms are substantially more concentrated in terms of
    hires from particular schools. The degree of concentration is highly
    variable, as there is substantial variation in firms? hiring strategies. Two
    main drivers of variation in law school concentration occur within law
    offices. First, geography drives a large amount of concentration, as most
    firms hire largely from local schools. Second, school-based networks (and
    possibly productive complementarities) appear to be important because
    partners? law schools drive associates? law school composition even when
    controlling for firm, school, and firm/school match characteristics and when
    instrumenting for partners? law schools.

    Some research on fowyers active in politics has found that the ties among
    them create networks in which a center or core of influential actors is
    surrounded by more peripheral participants. Other studies, however, found
    more segmented networks, sometimes lacking central players. This research
    examines the structure and determinants of political ties among forty-seven
    elite lawyers who served organizations prominent in fourteen national policy
    issues in 2004-05. The analysis finds a network structure that resembles a
    rough circle with Republicans on one side and Democrats on the other.
    Lawyers affiliated with organizations representing a broad consteUaúon of
    interests are closer to the center of the network, while those working for
    specialized or narrow causes tend to be located in the periphery. Ties are
    more dense among conservatives than among liberals. Lawyers who work as
    organizational leaders or managers are more likely to be near the center
    than are litigators. Central actors contribute larger amounts to election
    campaigns. The organized bar, especially the American Bar Association,
    appears to provide links between liberals and conservatives in one segment
    of the network.

    The scholarly literature on enforcement suggests that enforcement often
    fails to improve compliance because it insufficiently deters. The
    “deterrence trap” means that penalties for noncompliance will either not be
    big enough to deter rational misconduct, or they will be so large that they
    exceed the capacity of firms to pay, thereby damaging innocent employees and
    creditors. Moreover, there is a low probability of detection and successful
    enforcement action for most business offenses, making the perception of
    deterrence even less potent. Scholarly evidence and regulatory best practice
    suggest that regulators should generally use mixes of regulatory styles or
    strategies to improve

    “A compelling and readable story of resistance to the new economic order.”
    ―Boston GlobeIn the wake of the profound economic crisis known as the Great
    Depression, a group of high-powered individuals joined forces to campaign
    against the New Deal―not just its practical policies but the foundations of
    its economic philosophy. The titans of the National Association of
    Manufacturers and the chemicals giant DuPont, together with little-known men
    like W. C. Mullendore, Leonard Read, and Jasper Crane, championed European
    thinkers Friedrich von Hayek and Ludwig von Mises and their fears of the
    “nanny state.” Through fervent activism, fundraising, and
    institution-building, these men sought to educate and organize their peers
    as a political force to preserve their profit margins and the “American way”
    of doing business. In the public relations department of General Electric,
    they would find the perfect spokesman: Ronald Reagan. 16 black-and-white

    Thomas Piketty―whose Capital in the Twenty-First Century pushed inequality
    to the forefront of public debate―wrote The Economics of Inequality as an
    introduction to the conceptual and factual background necessary for
    interpreting changes in economic inequality over time. This concise text has
    established itself as an indispensable guide for students and general
    readers in France, where it has been regularly updated and revised.
    Translated by Arthur Goldhammer, The Economics of Inequality now appears in
    English for the first time.Piketty begins by explaining how inequality
    evolves and how economists measure it. In subsequent chapters, he explores
    variances in income and ownership of capital and the variety of policies
    used to reduce these gaps. Along the way, with characteristic clarity and
    precision, he introduces key ideas about the relationship between labor and
    capital, the effects of different systems of taxation, the distinction
    between “historical” and “political” time, the impact of education and
    technological change, the nature of capital markets, the role of unions, and
    apparent tensions between the pursuit of efficiency and the pursuit of
    fairness.Succinct, accessible, and authoritative, this is the ideal place to
    start for those who want to understand the fundamental issues at the heart
    of one of the most pressing concerns in contemporary economics and politics.

  abstract: >-
    The epic successor to one of the most important books of the century: at
    once a retelling of global history, a scathing critique of contemporary
    politics, and a bold proposal for a new and fairer economic system.Thomas
    Piketty’s bestselling Capital in the Twenty-First Century galvanized global
    debate about inequality. In this audacious follow-up, Piketty challenges us
    to revolutionize how we think about politics, ideology, and history. He
    exposes the ideas that have sustained inequality for the past millennium,
    reveals why the shallow politics of right and left are failing us today, and
    outlines the structure of a fairer economic system.Our economy, Piketty
    observes, is not a natural fact. Markets, profits, and capital are all
    historical constructs that depend on choices. Piketty explores the material
    and ideological interactions of conflicting social groups that have given us
    slavery, serfdom, colonialism, communism, and hypercapitalism, shaping the
    lives of billions. He concludes that the great driver of human progress over
    the centuries has been the struggle for equality and education and not, as
    often argued, the assertion of property rights or the pursuit of stability.
    The new era of extreme inequality that has derailed that progress since the
    1980s, he shows, is partly a reaction against communism, but it is also the
    fruit of ignorance, intellectual specialization, and our drift toward the
    dead-end politics of identity.Once we understand this, we can begin to
    envision a more balanced approach to economics and politics. Piketty argues
    for a new “participatory” socialism, a system founded on an ideology of
    equality, social property, education, and the sharing of knowledge and
    power. Capital and Ideology is destined to be one of the indispensable books
    of our time, a work that will not only help us understand the world, but
    that will change it.

    A compelling explanation of how the law shapes the distribution of
    wealthCapital is the defining feature of modern economies, yet most people
    have no idea where it actually comes from. What is it, exactly, that
    transforms mere wealth into an asset that automatically creates more wealth?
    The Code of Capital explains how capital is created behind closed doors in
    the offices of private attorneys, and why this little-known fact is one of
    the biggest reasons for the widening wealth gap between the holders of
    capital and everybody else.In this revealing book, Katharina Pistor argues
    that the law selectively “codes” certain assets, endowing them with the
    capacity to protect and produce private wealth. With the right legal coding,
    any object, claim, or idea can be turned into capital―and lawyers are the
    keepers of the code. Pistor describes how they pick and choose among
    different legal systems and legal devices for the ones that best serve their
    clients’ needs, and how techniques that were first perfected centuries ago
    to code landholdings as capital are being used today to code stocks, bonds,
    ideas, and even expectations―assets that exist only in law.A powerful new
    way of thinking about one of the most pernicious problems of our time, The
    Code of Capital explores the different ways that debt, complex financial
    products, and other assets are coded to give financial advantage to their
    holders. This provocative book paints a troubling portrait of the pervasive
    global nature of the code, the people who shape it, and the governments that
    enforce it.

  abstract: >-
    The institutional features and the past and future role of the state should
    be a central concern of contemporary sociological and political theory, but
    until now they have been sadly neglected. Lately, in particular, the
    state&#39;s increasing involvement in the management of industrial and
    industrializing societies has made it even more important to understand its
    past development, its current activities, and the related trends in its
    structure and in its relation to the larger society.  As a contribution to
    this task, Gianfranco Poggi reviews the main phases in the institutional
    history of the modern state. Restating a typology elaborated, among others
    by Max Weber, he outlines first the feudal system of rule, then the
    late-medieval Ständestaat and the absolutist state. Next the book discusses
    the nineteenth-century constitutional state, seen as the most accomplished
    embodiment of the modern, Western state. Finally, it points out the major
    developments which have occurred since the end of the last century in the
    relationship between the state and society, and identifies the threat these
    pose to the persistence of Western political values.  Throughout, the
    discussion draws upon an impressive body of literature on the modern state
    (much of it not available in English) from the fields of history, law, and
    the social sciences.

  abstract: >-
    The state is the most massive and significant modern expression of the
    broader phenomenon of political power. This book offers a fresh, accessible
    and original interpretation of the modern state, concentrating particularly
    on the emergence and nature of democracy.  Poggi presents an extensive
    conceptual portrait of the state, distinguishing its early characteristics
    from those that have developed subsequently and are apparent in contemporary
    states. He reviews the &quot;historical career&quot; of the state, from the
    dissolution of feudal forms of rule to the advent of modern,
    liberal-democratic systems.  Poggi also discusses the most significant
    developments occurring in our times concerning the nature of
    liberal-democratic regimes: these developments emphasize the growth and
    diversification of state action, and the resulting disconnection between
    policy and politics. Poggi considers the distinctive features of one=party
    systems, and discusses why these systems encountered difficulties in
    promoting advanced industrial development. The final chapter discusses the
    challenges set to the state by contemporary developments in military
    affairs, in the international economy and in the ecological sphere.  This
    book further develops themes introduced in Poggi&#39;s highly successful The
    Development of the Modern State (1978). It will be required reading for
    students of politics and sociology, but will also be of interest to
    postgraduates.

    In this classic work of economic history and social theory, Karl Polanyi
    analyzes the economic and social changes brought about by the "great
    transformation" of the Industrial Revolution. His analysis explains not only
    the deficiencies of the self-regulating market, but the potentially dire
    social consequences of untempered market capitalism. New introductory
    material reveals the renewed importance of Polanyi's seminal analysis in an
    era of globalization and free trade.

  abstract: >-
    During the twentieth century, Congress's power to regulate commerce grew
    sensationally while its human rights powers atrophied. The author traces
    this phenomenon back to the choice, made by lawyers and politicians in the
    early 1930s, to base labor rights statutes like the Wagner Act on the
    Commerce Clause instead of the Thirteenth Amendment. Unions and workers
    argued that the rights to organize and strike made the difference between
    freedom and involuntary servitude. But a bevy of progressive lawyers who
    styled themselves "friends of labor" undermined labor's Thirteenth Amendment
    theory. The author argues that this clash reflected not merely tactical
    differences among allies, but fundamentally conflicting constitutional
    goals. He contends that the Supreme Court upheld the Wagner Act not because
    of the lawyers' Commerce Clause arguments, but because workers staged a
    series of sit-down strikes that confronted the swing justices with a choice
    between industrial peace or war. Afterward, unions and workers interpreted
    the Wagner Act decisions as victories for labor freedom, but the Act's
    Commerce Clause foundation pointed in a different direction--one leading to
    fateful distortions in the jurisprudence of congressional powers.

    The author's goal in this article is to estimate the causal effect of
    unionization on institutional decision-making, using a national survey of
    presidents and faculty senate leaders to measure the level of shared
    governance at 341 public universities in 15 different areas. To handle the
    endogeneity of faculty unionization, an index of state employee collective
    bargaining rights is used as an instrument for unionization. Findings
    indicate that unionization greatly increases faculty influence over
    institutional decision-making, both in compensation and in areas outside of
    compensation.

    Revolutionary ideas on how to use markets to bring about fairness and
    prosperity for allMany blame today's economic inequality, stagnation, and
    political instability on the free market. The solution is to rein in the
    market, right? Radical Markets turns this thinking―and pretty much all
    conventional thinking about markets, both for and against―on its head. The
    book reveals bold new ways to organize markets for the good of everyone. It
    shows how the emancipatory force of genuinely open, free, and competitive
    markets can reawaken the dormant nineteenth-century spirit of liberal reform
    and lead to greater equality, prosperity, and cooperation.Eric Posner and
    Glen Weyl demonstrate why private property is inherently monopolistic, and
    how we would all be better off if private ownership were converted into a
    public auction for public benefit. They show how the principle of one
    person, one vote inhibits democracy, suggesting instead an ingenious way for
    voters to effectively influence the issues that matter most to them. They
    argue that every citizen of a host country should benefit from
    immigration―not just migrants and their capitalist employers. They propose
    leveraging antitrust laws to liberate markets from the grip of institutional
    investors and creating a data labor movement to force digital monopolies to
    compensate people for their electronic data.Only by radically expanding the
    scope of markets can we reduce inequality, restore robust economic growth,
    and resolve political conflicts. But to do that, we must replace our most
    sacred institutions with truly free and open competition―Radical Markets
    shows how.

    One of the main purposes of American labor law has been to reduce conflict
    between employers and workers. This paper discusses the ways in which
    various doctrines might serve this purpose. Four theories are examined:
    bargaining with asymmetric information; conflict; herding; and trust. The
    conflict and herding models provide the most useful perspectives for
    understanding why conflict (as opposed to inefficiency) is a concern for the
    government, and how it might be reduced through law.

  abstract: >-
    The far-reaching historical transformations of recent decades, including the
    decline of the Keynesian/Fordist organization of polity and economy in the
    West, the collapse of party-state command economies in the East, and the
    emergence of a neo-liberal capitalist global order, suggest that
    contemporary critical theory must be centrally concerned with historical
    dynamics and large-scale structural changes. The paper argues that these
    broad developments can best be apprehended by a theory premised on the
    Marxian theory of capital, but only if that category is fundamentally
    reconceptualized in ways that distinguish it from its usage in traditional
    Marxist interpretations.

    on close analysis of the Constitution’s original structure and the ways that
    structure both induced and accommodated changes over the centuries.   There
    was no clear agreement among the founding fathers regarding the "true”
    nature of American federalism, Purcell contends, nor was there a consensus
    on "correct” lines dividing state and national authority. Furthermore, even
    had there been some true "original” understanding, the elastic and dynamic
    nature of the constitutional structure would have made it impossible for
    subsequent generations to maintain any "original” or permanent balance. The
    author traces the evolution of federalism through the centuries, focusing
    particularly on shifting interpretations founded on political interests. He
    concludes with insights into current issues of federal power and a
    discussion of the grounds on which legitimate decisions about federal and
    state power should rest.

    Originalism, Federalism, and the American Constitutional Enterprise: A
    Historical Inquiry

  type: book

  abstract: >-
    Antonin Scalia and American Constitutionalism is an in-depth study of
    Justice Antonin Scalia's jurisprudence, his work on the Supreme Court, and
    his significance in the history of American constitutionalism. After tracing
    Scalia's rise to Associate Justice and his subsequent emergence as a hero of
    the Republican Party and the political right, this book reviews and
    criticizes his general jurisprudential theory, arguing that he failed to
    produce either the objective method he claimed or the correct constitutional
    results he promised. Focusing on his judicial performance over his thirty
    years on the Court, it examines his decisions and opinions on virtually all
    of the constitutional issues he addressed from the fundamentals of structure
    (federalism, separation of powers, and the Article III judicial power) to
    specific interpretations of most major constitutional provisions involving
    governmental powers and the rights of individuals under the Bill of Rights
    and the Fourteenth Amendment. This book argues that Scalia applied his
    jurisprudential theories in inconsistent and contradictory ways and often
    ignored, distorted, or abandoned the interpretive methods he proclaimed to
    reach the results he sought, results that were aligned with and supported by
    the post-Reagan Republican coalition. Scalia was far more consistent in
    enforcing such ideologically compatible results than he was in following his
    proclaimed jurisprudential theories. Finally, assessing Scalia's historical
    significance, Antonin Scalia and American Constitutionalism argues that his
    jurisprudence and career are particularly illuminating because they
    exemplify--contrary to his persistent claims--three paramount
    characteristics of American constitutionalism: the inherent inadequacy of
    originalism and other formal interpretive methodologies to produce
    consistent and correct answers to controverted constitutional questions; the
    close relationship that exists, particularly so in Scalia's case, between
    constitutional theories and interpretations on one hand and substantive
    political goals and values on the other; and the unavoidably living nature
    of American constitutionalism itself. All in all, Scalia stands as a
    towering figure of irony because his judicial career deconstructed the
    central claims of his own jurisprudence.

    COVID-19 is a deadly pandemic that has impacted all walks of human life. As
    we write this editorial, the traces of coronavirus still continue to remain
    in the world amid many continuing human efforts to wipe them out. Although
    the light of hope—the luminosity of freedom—is brimming on the horizon, it
    only consoles the soul. The sigh of relief is far off. Losses caused by this
    deadly monster have been countless—of lives, health, peace, love,
    protection, care, and security. Everyone’s heart goes out to the other—we
    are human, after all. But that’s not the best we can do in our fight against
    the Pandemic. We need to battle the malady. We need to gather the fragments
    strewn by the blow of the Pandemic and secure them from further destruction.
    We need to renew our creative energies. We need to renew our collective
    willing and acting.

  abstract: "The Great Recession intensified large law firms’ emphasis on financial performance, leading to claims that lawyers in these firms were now guided by business rather than professional values.\_ Based on interviews with more than 250 partners in large firms, Mitt Regan and Lisa H. Rohrer suggest that the reality is much more complex. It is true that large firm hiring, promotion, compensation, and termination policies are more influenced by business considerations than ever before and that firms actively recruit profitable partners from other firms to replace those they regard as unproductive. At the same time, law firm partners continue to seek the non-financial rewards of being members of a distinct profession and are sensitive to whether their firms are committed to providing them. Regan and Rohrer argue that modern firms responding effectively to business demands while credibly affirming the importance of non-financial professional values can create strong cultures that enhance their ability to weather the storms of the modern legal market."

    The chapter examines how academic labor markets in the U.S. are socially
    structured. These markets express and enhance social stratification, and are
    reproduced and renegotiated through ongoing social action. First, we review
    the classic literature on the subject. Then we consider the presence of
    secondary labor markets in STEM fields, contextualizing our consideration of
    academic labor markets in developments in the larger labor force.
    Subsequently, we focus on academic labor markets in terms of “academic
    capitalism” and the restructuring of academic institutions, “managed
    professionals” and the restructuring of academic labor, and the efforts of
    “organizing professionals” to negotiate a new academy. Analytically, we
    focus on rising secondary labor markets. We also attend to their social
    demography, noting international and local dimensions that take us beyond
    and below the national labor markets that are the literature’s overriding
    focus. Finally, we map a new research agenda, for newly structured academic
    labor markets.

  abstract: >-
    From workers' wages to presidential elections, labor unions once exerted
    tremendous clout in American life. In the immediate post-World War II era,
    one in three workers belonged to a union. The fraction now is close to one
    in ten, and just one in twenty in the private sector--the lowest in a
    century. The only thing big about Big Labor today is the scope of its
    problems. While many studies have attempted to explain the causes of this
    decline, What Unions No Longer Do lays bare the broad repercussions of
    labor's collapse for the American economy and polity.Organized labor was not
    just a minor player during the "golden age" of welfare capitalism in the
    middle decades of the twentieth century, Jake Rosenfeld asserts. Rather, for
    generations it was the core institution fighting for economic and political
    equality in the United States. Unions leveraged their bargaining power to
    deliver tangible benefits to workers while shaping cultural understandings
    of fairness in the workplace. The labor movement helped sustain an
    unprecedented period of prosperity among America's expanding, increasingly
    multiethnic middle class.What Unions No Longer Do shows in detail the
    consequences of labor's decline: curtailed advocacy for better working
    conditions, weakened support for immigrants' economic assimilation, and
    ineffectiveness in addressing wage stagnation among African Americans. In
    short, unions are no longer instrumental in combating inequality in our
    economy and our politics, and the result is a sharp decline in the prospects
    of American workers and their families.

    "American Workers, American Movies: Historiography and Methodology" surveys
    the ways in which scholars have examined the relationship between workers
    and movies. For many years, scholarship about movies and workers took one of
    two basic approaches: Cinema scholars wrote about images of workers in
    films, while labor historians wrote histories of union activity within the
    movie industry. The two schools were usually quite distinct. In the last
    twenty years, a burst of scholarship in both fields has broadened our
    understandings of the images that appeared on the screen and, in some cases,
    how those images were constructed in the first place. The goal of this essay
    is twofold: to review key themes and recent works in the field, and to
    suggest ways in which working-class historians might approach and
    incorporate studies of film into their own work. Indeed, the author calls
    upon scholars to go beyond simply deconstructing images, and to explore more
    complicated questions involving the forces responsible for shaping the
    ideology and class focus on American cinema.

    I study the effects of requiring lawyers to pass the bar exam on whether
    they are later publicly disciplined for misconduct. In the 1980s, by
    abolishing what is known as a diploma privilege, four states began to
    require graduates from all law schools to pass the bar exam. My research
    design exploits these events to estimate the effect of the bar passage
    requirement on the share of lawyers publicly sanctioned by state discipline
    bodies. I find that during the first decade of their careers lawyers
    licensed without a bar passage requirement are publicly sanctioned at
    similar rates to lawyers licensed after passing a bar exam. Small
    differences do begin to emerge after a decade, however, and larger though
    still modest differences form after two decades.

    I investigate the labor market outcomes of American lawyers after they are
    professionally disciplined. To do so, I match employment data for 672k
    lawyers in 2012 and 2020 to novel data on public disciplinary measures
    imposed by state licensing bodies since 1990. I use this data to study
    discipline and employment in three ways. First, I document the prevalence
    and distribution of discipline. I find that 4.4 percent of lawyers are
    professionally disciplined and that half of disciplined lawyers who are not
    disbarred go on to reoffend. I also find that disciplined lawyers are not
    representative of the legal profession in terms of the type of law firms
    they work for and their practice areas. Second, I document the labor market
    outcomes of disciplined lawyers after they are disciplined and compare them
    to the labor market outcomes of similar non-disciplined lawyers. I find that
    disciplined lawyers are more likely to subsequently end up in law firms with
    limited oversight and in practice areas with unsophisticated clients.
    Finally, I investigate causal channels that could explain the labor market
    outcomes of disciplined lawyers and find suggestive evidence that they
    likely operate through law firms' concerns over reputation and by serving as
    a signal of lawyer type.

  abstract: >-
    This paper explores one possible explanation for the uniquely apolitical
    character of the U.S. labor movement compared to the labor movements of
    other Western capitalist democracies. Employing a neo-Marxist class
    perspective, the author examines the relationship of union density (union
    members as a percentage of the nonagricultural work force) and of strike
    frequency to the distribution of earned income in the United States from
    1949 to 1976. Time-series regression analysis of the quintile distribution
    of earned income and the Gini index of the inequality of earned income shows
    that union density has had mixed effects on inequality, with higher union
    density tending to redistribute income from middle-income workers to both
    the least prosperous and most prosperous workers, whereas higher strike
    frequency has tended to reduce income inequality generally. The author
    suggests that union organization may be a source of divisiveness within the
    working class in the postwar era.

  abstract: >-
    America’s runaway inequality has an engine: our unjust tax system.Even as
    they became fabulously wealthy, the ultra-rich have had their taxes collapse
    to levels last seen in the 1920s. Meanwhile, working-class Americans have
    been asked to pay more. The Triumph of Injustice presents a forensic
    investigation into this dramatic transformation, written by two economists
    who revolutionized the study of inequality. Eschewing anecdotes and case
    studies, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman offer a comprehensive view of
    America’s tax system, based on new statistics covering all taxes paid at all
    levels of government. Their conclusion? For the first time in more than a
    century, billionaires now pay lower tax rates than their
    secretaries.Blending history and cutting-edge economic analysis, and writing
    in lively and jargon-free prose, Saez and Zucman dissect the deliberate
    choices (and sins of indecision) that have brought us to today: the gradual
    exemption of capital owners; the surge of a new tax avoidance industry, and
    the spiral of tax competition among nations. With clarity and concision,
    they explain how America turned away from the most progressive tax system in
    history to embrace policies that only serve to compound the wealth of a
    few.But The Triumph of Injustice is much more than a laser-sharp analysis of
    one of the great political and intellectual failures of our time. Saez and
    Zucman propose a visionary, democratic, and practical reinvention of taxes,
    outlining reforms that can allow tax justice to triumph in today’s
    globalized world and democracy to prevail over concentrated wealth.A
    pioneering companion website allows anyone to evaluate proposals made by the
    authors, and to develop their own alternative tax reform at
    taxjusticenow.org.

    T]here has been a great increase in the number of rankings of educational
    institutions published by widely circulating magazines and newspapers both
    in the United States and internationally. Part of a general trend toward
    increased accountability and transparency through the development of social
    measures, this proliferation of rankings has generated much concern about
    their validity, how students use them, and how the behaviors of schools are
    changed in reaction to them. Nowhere is this concern more palpable than in
    the field of legal education. Perhaps because there is a single publication
    that dominates the field of law school rankings— *U.S* .

    Since the turn of the twenty-first century, Canadian unions have scored a
    number of important Supreme Court victories, securing constitutional rights
    to picket, bargain collectively, and strike. Unions in Court documents the
    evolution of the Canadian labour movement's engagement with the Charter,
    demonstrating how and why labour's long-standing distrust of the legal
    system has given way to a controversial, Charter-based legal strategy. This
    book's in-depth examination of constitutional labour rights will have
    critical implications for labour movements as well as activists in other
    fields.

    and perceived. Now featuring a new introduction by Schumpeter biographer
    Thomas K. McCraw, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy is essential
    read&#173;ing for anyone who seeks to understand where the world economy is
    headed.

    This sensitive picture of the constant and circumspect struggle waged by
    peasants materially and ideologically against their oppressors shows that
    techniques of evasion and resistance may represent the most significant and
    effective means of class struggle in the long run."A major contribution to
    peasant studies, Malaysian studies, and the literature on revolutions and
    class consciousness."--Benedict R. Anderson, Cornell University"The book is
    a splendid achievement. Because Scott listens closely to the villagers of
    Malaysia, he enormously expands our understanding of popular ideology and
    therefore of popular politics. And because he is also a brilliant analyst,
    he draws upon this concrete experience to develop a new critique of
    classical theories of ideology."―Frances Fox Piven, Graduate Center of the
    City University of New York“An impressive work which may well become a
    classic.”―Terence J. Byres, Times Literary Supplement“A highly readable,
    contextually sensitive, theoretically astute ethnography of a moral system
    in change…. Weapons of the Weak is a brilliant book, combining a sure feel
    for the subjective side of struggle with a deft handling of economic and
    political trends.”―John R. Bown, Journal of Peasant Studies“A splendid book,
    a worthy addition to the classic studies of Malay society and of the
    peasantry at large…. Combines the readability of Akenfield or Pig Earth with
    an accessible and illuminating theoretical commentary.”―A.F. Robertson,
    Times Higher Education Supplement“No one who wants to understand peasant
    society, in or out of Southeast Asia, or theories of change, should fail to
    read [this book].”―Daniel S. Lev, Journal of Asian Studies“A moving account
    of the poor’s refusal to accept the terms of their subordination…. Disposes
    of the belief that theoretical sophistication and intelligible prose are
    somehow at odds.”―Ramachandra Guha, Economic and Political Weekly“A
    seminally important commentary on the state of peasant studies and the
    global literature…. This enormously rich work in Asian and comparative
    studies is… an essential contribution to participatory development theory
    and practice.”―Guy Gran, World DevelopmentJames C. Scott is professor of

  abstract: >-
    From the acclaimed author and scholar James C. Scott, the compelling tale of
    Asian peoples who until recently have stemmed the vast tide of state-making
    to live at arm’s length from any organized state society For two thousand
    years the disparate groups that now reside in Zomia (a mountainous region
    the size of Europe that consists of portions of seven Asian countries) have
    fled the projects of the organized state societies that surround
    them—slavery, conscription, taxes, corvée labor, epidemics, and warfare.
    This book, essentially an “anarchist history,” is the first-ever examination
    of the huge literature on state-making whose author evaluates why people
    would deliberately and reactively remain stateless. Among the strategies
    employed by the people of Zomia to remain stateless are physical dispersion
    in rugged terrain; agricultural practices that enhance mobility; pliable
    ethnic identities; devotion to prophetic, millenarian leaders; and
    maintenance of a largely oral culture that allows them to reinvent their
    histories and genealogies as they move between and around states.In
    accessible language, James Scott, recognized worldwide as an eminent
    authority in Southeast Asian, peasant, and agrarian studies, tells the story
    of the peoples of Zomia and their unlikely odyssey in search of
    self-determination. He redefines our views on Asian politics, history,
    demographics, and even our fundamental ideas about what constitutes
    civilization, and challenges us with a radically different approach to
    history that presents events from the perspective of stateless peoples and
    redefines state-making as a form of “internal colonialism.” This new
    perspective requires a radical reevaluation of the civilizational narratives
    of the lowland states. Scott’s work on Zomia represents a new way to think
    of area studies that will be applicable to other runaway, fugitive, and
    marooned communities, be they Gypsies, Cossacks, tribes fleeing slave
    raiders, Marsh Arabs, or San-Bushmen.

  abstract: "Have you ever wondered how the 8 hour work day happened?\_Or how we have a 40 hour work week, sick days, pensions or vacations? It didn’t happen because a politician or president gave it to us; it happened because people came together, organized, and fought for it. This is the story of American labor history as told in a \"This day in labor history\" format. See what happened on your birthday, your anniversary or any of the other 363 days in Labor History.\_Read how working-class leaders like Mother Jones, Eugene Debs, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and Joe Hill, and everyday workers made US Labor History by striking, protesting and even dying for what they believed in. Read how their battles and deaths made your work life safer and made the American working class the envy of the world. Why is knowing this history important? Because it’s starting to repeat itself. The bosses (the 1%) have never liked unions and are working hard to destroy them even as you read this. The recent Janus v. AFSCME decision at the US Supreme Court is just another swipe at the power of working people to have a voice for themselves in the workplace. Even now, they work at ways to weaken OSHA, take away our pensions, and strip us of our overtime pay.\_Today in Labor History …January 14th - The Red for Ed campaign continues into 2019 with 34,000 Los Angeles teachers going out on strike. Fighting for smaller class size, more nurses, librarians, and support staff, and a limit on charter school expansion, they took on the billionaires and won. After 6 school days on the picket line and a majority of parents keeping their children home, the teachers were victorious on most of their issues and got a 6% pay raise to boot. - 2019January 19th - Joe Hill was arrested on this date in Salt Lake City and later convicted on trumped-up murder charges. He was executed 21 months later despite worldwide protests and two attempts to intervene by President Woodrow Wilson. In a letter to Bill Haywood shortly before his death, he penned the famous words, “Don’t mourn – organize!”. - 1915April 21st - Company guards shot down 17 unarmed striking miners near the Neversweat Mine of the Anaconda Copper Mining Co. They were all shot in the back as they tried to flee. The IWW and the Metal Mine Workers Industrial Union called for a strike in the mines around Butte. They struck to secure higher wages, end rustling cards, and win an eight hour day. The Company blamed the IWW for the violence, and federal troops arrived the next day to impose martial law and end the strike. Miners were forced back to the mines at gunpoint. -1920June 30th - Alabama outlawed the leasing of convicts to mine coal, a practice that had been in place since 1848. In 1898, 73 percent of the state’s total revenue came from this source. Twenty-five percent of all black leased convicts died. - 1928September 3rd - Twenty-five workers died, and 55 were injured, unable to escape a fire at the Imperial Poultry processing plant in Hamlet, North Carolina. Managers had locked fire doors to prevent the theft of chicken nuggets. The plant had operated for 11 years without a single safety inspection. - 1991December 2nd - A Chicago “slugger,” paid $50 by labor unions for every scab he “discouraged,” described his job in an interview: “Oh, there ain’t nothing to it. I gets my fifty, then I goes out and finds the guy they wanna have slugged, then I gives it to ‘im”. - 1911These are just a few of the thousands of events in “Voices of Labor - History of the Working Class”This is the perfect book for new or old union members alike. Get your copy today, and then run out and make a little labor history yourself.“Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it” George Santayana"

    Lawyers Crossing Lines is a collection of true stories about lawyers from
    all segments of the legal profession who transgressed ethical boundaries.
    Most of them ended up being sanctioned by their state Bar, sued for
    malpractice, prosecuted, or some combination of all three. All of the cases
    are rich in detail, many are bizarre, and in a few the attorney's conduct is
    so outrageous as to stretch the reader¿s credulity. Each tale is followed by
    comments and questions designed to explore the issues in greater depth. This
    diminutive but captivating volume is intended as a supplemental text for
    students in professional responsibility courses at American law schools. It
    can also be used as the foundation for an advanced seminar in ethics. It is
    based on the proposition that, although the rules of professional
    responsibility are, of course, of supreme importance, sometimes the study of
    them can be monotonous and dry. More important, students -- none of whom
    have been in law practice and most of whom have never been out in the
    working world -- often find it hard to believe that the rules can be so
    easily and egregiously broken. These real world scenarios bring the ethical
    quandaries faced in everyday legal practice to life. The stories come from
    all segments of the legal profession and make fascinating and memorable
    reading. No other book on the market takes this narrative approach, making
    this an important and unique contribution to the field.

    This article reports findings from a randomized experiment to test the

    tenants in New York City’s Housing Court. While almost all landlords in
    Housing Court have the benefit of legal representation, the vast majority of
    tenants do not. Legal advocates for the poor have thus argued for a right to
    legal counsel in Housing Court, similar to the right that exists in Criminal
    Court, on grounds that it would ensure due process of law and procedural
    safeguards in an area of vital interest to tenants, their families, and
    society. Aside

    Accumulating evidence points to the need for more vigorous antitrust
    enforcement in the United States in three areas. First, stricter merger
    control is warranted in an economy where large, highly efficient and
    profitable "superstar" firms account for an increasing share of economic
    activity. Evidence from merger retrospectives further supports the
    conclusion that stricter merger control is needed. Second, greater vigilance
    is needed to prevent dominant firms, including the tech titans, from
    engaging in exclusionary conduct. The systematic shrinking of the scope of
    the Sherman Act by the Supreme Court over the past 40 years may make this
    difficult. Third, greater antitrust scrutiny should be given to the
    monopsony power of employers in labor markets.

    Legal consciousness as a theoretical concept and topic of empirical research
    developed to address issues of legal hegemony, particularly how the law
    sustains its institutional power despite a persistent gap between the law on
    the books and the law in action. Why do people acquiesce to a legal system
    that, despite its promises of equal treatment, systematically reproduces
    inequality? Recent studies have both broadened and narrowed the concept's
    reach, while sacrificing much of the concept's critical edge and theoretical
    utility. Rather than explaining how the different experiences of law become
    synthesized into a set of circulating schemas and habits, the literature
    tracks what particular individuals think and do. Because the relationships
    among consciousness and processes of ideology and hegemony often go
    unexplained, legal consciousness as an analytic concept is domesticated
    within what appear to be policy projects: making specific laws work better
    for particular groups or interests.

    Susan Silbey began her academic training in political science and in the
    course of her studies became a sociologist of law, the last two decades as a
    member of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's anthropology
    department and management school. The disciplinary transformations ground,
    in part, her attention to the ways in which the everyday life of scholarship
    has led her to study the everyday life of the law. In this article, she
    describes her scholarly life through seven chapters of relatively distinct
    challenges and themes. Across the arc of her life, she identifies the
    recurrent influence of both serendipity and theoretical inference acting
    within the immediate constraints of family and personal capacity. Reading
    across descriptions of her work on regulatory enforcement, dispute
    negotiation and mediation, and popular legal culture and consciousness, she
    points to the necessity of reconciling on-the-ground vicissitudes of doing
    legal work with the theories and narratives social scientists construct to
    make sense of institutions and history. She muses on theoretical attempts to
    align the particular and the general, the micro and macro forces working in
    legal cultures, and concludes by celebrating the ubiquity of social ordering
    whose own momentum both seduces and frustrates social scientists.

    Regulators of the legal profession are charged with protecting the public by
    ensuring lawyers are fit to practice law. However, their approach tends to
    be reactive and case based, focusing on the resolution of individual
    complaints. Regulators generally do not seek to identify patterns and trends
    across their broader caseloads and the legal profession as a whole. Using
    administrative data routinely collected by the main regulator of the legal
    profession in Victoria, Australia, we characterized complaints lodged
    between 2005 and 2015 and the lawyers against whom they were made. We also
    analyzed risk factors for complaints and misconduct findings. We found that
    the odds of being subject to a complaint were higher among lawyers who were
    male, older, had trust account authority, and whose legal practices were
    smaller, in nonurban locations, and incorporated. A deeper understanding of
    these risk factors could support efforts to improve professional standards
    and reform regulatory practices.

    Characteristics of Lawyers Who Are Subject to Complaints and Misconduct

    Public trust in the legal profession rests on regulators taking timely and
    effective action in response to misconduct. Usually, case-by-case analysis
    occurs after a claim or complaint is lodged with little attention on factors
    that may predispose a lawyer to misconduct. Vulnerability is a useful
    concept for understanding individuals’ susceptibility to harm and for
    identifying safeguards to protect against that harm. This empirical study
    adds to the largely normative research on vulnerability with an analysis of
    67 “problem lawyers” who were the subject of multiple complaints and at
    least one disciplinary hearing, a paid financial misconduct claim, or
    striking from the roll in Victoria, Australia between 2005 and 2015. We
    analysed determinations about these lawyers and identified a concatenation
    of factors associated with legal misconduct. Personal vulnerabilities
    included older age, male sex, poor health, and patterns of behaviour such as
    low conscientiousness. Situational vulnerabilities included working as a
    sole principal or in a small practice, excessive workload, and pressures
    from relationship breakdowns, death or illness in the family, or financial
    difficulties. These findings shed light on vulnerabilities to legal
    misconduct, and have implications for lawyer education and well-being,
    protection of clients, and efforts to reduce lapses in professionalism.

    State structures, international forces, and class relations: Theda Skocpol
    shows how all three combine to explain the origins and accomplishments of
    social-revolutionary transformations. From France in the 1790s to Vietnam in
    the 1970s, social revolutions have been rare but undeniably of enormous
    importance in modern world history. States and Social Revolutions provides a
    new frame of reference for analyzing the causes, the conflicts, and the
    outcomes of such revolutions. And it develops in depth a rigorous,
    comparative historical analysis of three major cases: the French Revolution
    of 1787 through the early 1800s, the Russian Revolution of 1917 through the
    1930s, and the Chinese Revolution of 1911 through the 1960s. Believing that
    existing theories of revolution, both Marxist and non-Marxist, are
    inadequate to explain the actual historical patterns of revolutions, the
    author urges us to adopt fresh perspectives. Above all, she maintains that
    states conceived as administrative and coercive organizations potentially
    autonomous from class controls and interests must be made central to
    explanations of revolutions.

  abstract: >-
    From the dawn of the twentieth century to the early 1960s, public-sector
    unions generally had no legal right to strike, bargain, or arbitrate, and
    government workers could be fired simply for joining a union. Public Workers
    is the first book to analyze why public-sector labor law evolved as it did,
    separate from and much more restrictive than private-sector labor law, and
    what effect this law had on public-sector unions, organized labor as a
    whole, and by extension all of American politics. Joseph E. Slater shows how
    public-sector unions survived, represented their members, and set the stage
    for the most remarkable growth of worker organization in American history.
    Slater examines the battles of public-sector unions in the workplace,
    courts, and political arena, from the infamous Boston police strike of 1919,
    to teachers in Seattle fighting a yellow-dog rule, to the BSEIU in the 1930s
    representing public-sector janitors, to the fate of the powerful Transit
    Workers Union after New York City purchased the subways, to the long
    struggle by AFSCME that produced the nation's first public-sector labor law
    in Wisconsin in 1959. Slater introduces readers to a determined and
    often-ignored segment of the union movement and expands our knowledge of
    working men and women, the institutions they formed, and the organizational
    obstacles they faced.

  abstract: >-
    An argument that America's economy needs a strong and innovative
    manufacturing sector and the jobs it creates.“There's no author whose books
    I look forward to more than Vaclav Smil.”―Bill GatesIn Made in the USA,
    Vaclav Smil powerfully rebuts the notion that manufacturing is a relic of
    predigital history and that the loss of American manufacturing is a
    desirable evolutionary step toward a pure service economy. Smil argues that
    no advanced economy can prosper without a strong, innovative manufacturing
    sector and the jobs it creates. Smil explains how manufacturing became a
    fundamental force behind America's economic, strategic, and social
    dominance. He describes American manufacturing's rapid rise at the end of
    the nineteenth century, its consolidation and modernization between the two
    world wars, its role as an enabler of mass consumption after 1945, and its
    recent decline. Some economists argue that shipping low-value jobs overseas
    matters little because the high-value work remains in the United States.
    But, asks Smil, do we want a society that consists of a small population of
    workers doing high-value-added work and masses of unemployed? Smil assesses
    various suggestions for solving America's manufacturing crisis, including
    lowering corporate tax rates, promoting research and development, and
    improving public education. Will America act to preserve and reinvigorate
    its manufacturing? It is crucial to our social and economic well-being; but,
    Smil warns, the odds are no better than even.

    Abstract This personal account of a former Czechoslovak Jewish Youth leader
    offers insights into the process of searching for Jewish identity and its
    meaning in post-Communist Czechoslovakia. The author discusses the
    conceptual struggles faced by his generation, raised during the last two
    decades of the Communist regime, the impact of imported ideological
    infighting and factional splits on the makeup of an emerging community, the
    pop-appeal of Judaism to the Czech masses and the varied reactions of the
    highly assimilated Czech Jews to the eventual arrival of a dogmatic
    religious leadership.

    This paper attempts to further theoretical and empirical understanding of
    adherent and constituent mobilization by proposing and analyzing frame
    alignment as a conceptual bridge linking social psychological and resource
    mobilization views on movement participation. Extension of Goffman's (1974)
    frame analytic perspective provides the conceptual/theoretical framework;
    field research on two religious movements, the peace movement, and several
    neighborhood movements provide the primary empirical base. Four frame
    alignment processes are identified and elaborated: frame bridging, frame
    amplification, frame extension, and frame transformation. The basic
    underlying premise is that frame alignment, of one variety or another, is a
    necessary condition for participation, whatever its nature or intensity, and
    that it is typically an interactional and ongoing accomplishment. The paper
    concludes with an elaboration of several sets of theoretical and research
    implications.

    In 1861, Nevada became the first state to pass a law specifically barring
    marriages between whites and Asians. Over the course of the next century,
    until the 1967 Supreme Court decision *Loving v. Virginia* declared
    anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional, an additional 14 states came to
    ban marriages between whites and Asians. While social scientists have
    detailed extensively how whites created laws to limit the rights and
    privileges of minority groups within the United States, less frequently
    examined are the manner by which these laws helped shape and determine the
    meaning of racial groups and the features selected to demarcate group
    boundaries.

  abstract: "A timely and multifaceted portrait of the lawyers who serve the diverse constituencies of the conservative movement, Lawyers of the Right explains what unites and divides lawyers for the three major groups—social conservatives, libertarians, and business advocates—that have coalesced in recent decades behind the Republican Party.\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Drawing on in-depth interviews with more than seventy lawyers who represent conservative and libertarian nonprofit organizations, Ann Southworth explores their values and identities and traces the implications of their shared interest in promoting political strategies that give lawyers leading roles. She goes on to illuminate the function of mediator organizations—such as the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy—that have succeeded in promoting cooperation among different factions of conservative lawyers. Such cooperation, she finds, has aided efforts to drive law and the legal profession politically rightward and to give lawyers greater prominence in the conservative movement. Southworth concludes, though, that tensions between the conservative law movement’s elite and populist elements may ultimately lead to its undoing."

    Politics and Constitutionalism presents a collection of eight original
    essays by leading political science and law scholars, organized to recognize
    and analyze Louis Fisher&#39;s prolific and important body of work. The
    essays explore the role of all three branches of government in shaping
    constitutional meaning and institutional behavior, noting that the courts do
    not have sole interpretive power. This principle is applied to such topics
    as the dynamic of key court rulings, federalism, war powers, diplomacy,
    government secrecy, and the impact of the legal community on constitutional
    interpretation. The book&#39;s contributors also turn renewed attention to
    the study of American institutions as the fountainhead of political
    analysis, a movement in which Fisher has been a pioneer. Fisher himself
    contributes a summative essay. Contributors include David Gray Adler, Dean
    Alfange, Jr., Neal Devins, Louis Fisher, Michael J. Glennon, Loch K.
    Johnson, Nancy Kassop, and Robert J. Spitzer.

    The 1998 edition was part of the 1997 celebration of the 50th anniversary of
    the National Academy of Arbitrators, and summarized some of the leading
    arbitral principles developed over the preceding half century in labor and
    employment arbitration. The Academy and the contributors were then and
    remain adamant that these accounts are not setting out definitive rules, but
    merely describing principles that have surfaced and the thinking that led to
    them. People just entering the field have found the deliberations of
    veterans especially useful. The second edition incorporates new emphases
    such as ethics, external law, and drug use and violence. It also addresses a
    major criticism of the first edition by adding an index. Annotation ©2005

    Abstract The view that some or all of the Khazars, a central Asian people,
    converted to Judaism at some point during the ninth or tenth century is
    widely accepted. A careful examination of the sources, however, shows that
    some of them are pseudepigraphic, and the rest are of questionable
    reliability. Many of the most reliable contemporary texts that mention
    Khazars say nothing about their conversion, nor is there any archaeological
    evidence for it. This leads to the conclusion that such a conversion never
    took place.

    There is no question that knowledge about the history and stages of early
    Jewish settlement in East Central Europe, and about the number of Jews in
    the region at various times, is important for many reasons. While these
    topics have not been neglected, new data, and novel (as well as not so
    novel) methodologies, can add to our knowledge. Certainly, additional
    sources, when found, will make it possible to refine the historical picture

    In this chapter I begin by arguing that in the very text that constitutes
    one of the finest moments of classical sociology’s commitment and struggle
    for progressive, liberal society, Durkheim’s 1898 intervention in the
    Dreyfus affair, “Individualism and the Intellectuals,” ambivalences are
    operative that undermine this commitment and point instead to contradictions
    at the heart of modernity itself. Then I turn to another canonical text and
    argue that Max Weber wrote *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of
    Capitalism* as a pro-capitalist challenge to German nationalist
    denunciations of the capitalist, or the American spirit, as mere
    utilitarianism, while maintaining intact

    Thinking develops in the engagement with an object.¹ However, although

    issues that served as the catalysts around which European (or “Western”)

    was the question of Jewish emancipation, and after emancipation was
    achieved, the question of whether, how, or to what extent it ought to be

    This essay aims to contribute to a better understanding of the concept of
    'left-wing antisemitism'. It points to 'anti-imperialism', i.e. the
    nationalist, often culturalist, resistance to the global spread of the
    capitalist mode of production, as a crucial context of contemporary
    antisemitism in which the boundaries between 'right-wing' and 'leftwing' are
    often blurred. The main contention is that the dialectic of capitalism and
    emancipation is central to understanding antisemitism: the fact that
    capitalism itself creates the conditions of, and the means for, overcoming
    capitalism produces the space of confusion in which the concept of
    'left-wing antisemitism' emerges.

    This volume provides a systematic re-examination of the Frankfurt School's
    theory of antisemitism and, employing this critical theory, investigates the
    presence of antisemitism in 20th- and 21st-century politics and society. 
    Critical Theory and the Critique of Antisemitism uncovers how critical
    theory differs from mainstream socialist or liberal critiques of
    antisemitism, as it frames its rejection of antisemitism in the critique of
    other aspects of modern capitalist society, which traditional theories leave
    unchallenged or critique only in passing. Amongst others, these include
    issues of identity, nation, race, and sexuality. In exploring the Frankfurt
    School's writings on antisemitism therefore, the chapters in this book
    reveal connections to other pressing societal issues, such as racism more
    broadly, patriarchy, statism, and the societal dynamics of the ever-evolving
    capitalist mode of production.  Putting the theory to practice, this volume
    brings together interdisciplinary scholars and activists who employ critical
    theory to scrutinise right- and left-wing manifestations of antisemitism.
    They develop, in their critique of antisemitism, a critique of capitalism,
    as the authors ask: why does modern capitalist society seem bound to produce
    antisemitism? And how do we challenge it?  At a time when the rise of
    populism internationally has brought with it new strains of antisemitism,
    this is an essential resource that demonstrates the continuing relevance of
    the critical theory of the Frankfurt School for the struggle against
    antisemitism today.

  abstract: "A spectacular example of collective violence, the Great Strikes of 1877 was the first national strike and the first major strikes against the railroad industry. In some places, notably St. Louis, non-railroad workers also abandoned city businesses, creating one of the nation’s first general strikes. Mobilizing hundreds of thousands of workers, the Great Strikes of 1877 transformed the nation’s political landscape, shifting the primary political focus from Reconstruction to labor, capital, and the changing role of the state. Including essays by distinguished historians exploring the social, political, regional, and ethnic landscape of the Great Strikes of 1877, this collection investigates long-term effects on state militias and national guard units; ethnic and class characterization of strikers; pictorial depictions of poor laborers in the press; organizational strategies employed by railroad workers; participation by blacks; violence against Chinese immigrants; and the developing tension between capitalism and racial equality in the United States.  \_ Contributors include Joshua Brown, Steven J. Hoffman, Michael Kazin, David Miller, Richard Schneirov, David O. Stowell, and Shelton Stromquist."

    The modern state, however we conceive of it today, is based on a pattern
    that emerged in Europe in the period from 1100 to 1600. Inspired by a
    lifetime of teaching and research, On the Medieval Origins of the Modern
    State is a classic work on what is known about the early history of the
    European state. This short, clear book book explores the European state in
    its infancy, especially in institutional developments in the administration
    of justice and finance. Forewords from Charles Tilly and William Chester
    Jordan demonstrate the perennial importance of Joseph Strayer's book, and
    situate it within a contemporary context. Tilly demonstrates how Strayer's
    work has set the agenda for a whole generation of historical analysts, not
    only in medieval history but also in the comparative study of state
    formation. William Chester Jordan's foreword examines the scholarly and
    pedagogical setting within which Strayer produced his book, and how this
    both enhanced its accessibility and informed its focus on peculiarly English
    and French accomplishments in early state formation.

    The importance of simulation in education, specifically in legal subjects,
    is here discussed and explored within this innovative collection.
    Demonstrating how simulation can be constructed and developed for learning,
    teaching and assessment, the text argues that simulation is a pedagogically
    valuable and practical tool in teaching the modern law curriculum. With
    contributions from law teachers within the UK, Australia, Hong Kong, South
    Africa and the USA, the authors draw on their experiences in teaching law in
    the areas of clinical legal education, legal process, evidence, criminal
    law, family law and employment law as well as teaching law to non-law
    students. They claim that simulation, as a form of experiential and
    problem-based learning, enables students to integrate the ’classroom’
    experience with the real world experiences they will encounter in their
    professional lives. This book will be of relevance not only to law teachers
    but university teachers generally, as well as those interested in legal
    education and the theory of law.

    Until recently, dominant theoretical paradigms in the comparative social
    sciences did not highlight states as organizational structures or as
    potentially autonomous actors. Indeed, the term 'state' was rarely used.
    Current work, however, increasingly views the state as an agent which,
    although influenced by the society that surrounds it, also shapes social and
    political processes. The contributors to this volume, which includes some of
    the best recent interdisciplinary scholarship on states in relation to
    social structures, make use of theoretically engaged comparative and
    historical investigations to provide improved conceptualizations of states
    and how they operate. Each of the book's major parts presents a related set
    of analytical issues about modern states, which are explored in the context
    of a wide range of times and places, both contemporary and historical, and
    in developing and advanced-industrial nations. The first part examines state
    strategies in newly developing countries. The second part analyzes war
    making and state making in early modern Europe, and discusses states in
    relation to the post-World War II international economy. The third part
    pursues new insights into how states influence political cleavages and
    collective action. In the final chapter, the editors bring together the
    questions raised by the contributors and suggest tentative conclusions that
    emerge from an overview of all the articles. As a programmatic work that
    proposes new directions for the analysis of modern states, the volume will
    appeal to a wide range of teachers and students of political science,
    political economy, sociology, history, and anthropology.

    In revisiting the Jewish reception of Kafka, I would like to begin with a
    story that Franz Kafka told Milena Jesenská, his Czech translator and lover.
    In this story, Kafka tells Milena of his own interest in the problem of
    “universal” definitions – those ways we categorize other people. The topic
    of Kafka’s story is the commonplace definitions that are used to distinguish
    Germans from Jews. The tale concerns Mathilde, the wife of Heinrich Heine,
    the greatest – we could say the most universally loved – German-Jewish
    writer before Kafka. “Next we come to Judaism,” Kafka tells Milena, after a

    The question of antisemitism inside of the Left--referred to as "left
    antisemitism"--is a stubborn and persistent problem. And while the Right
    exaggerates both its depth and scope, the Left has repeatedly refused to
    face the issue. It is entangled in scandals about antisemitism at an
    increasing rate. On the Western Left, some antisemitism manifests in the
    form of conspiracy theories, but there is also a hegemonic refusal to
    acknowledge antisemitism's existence and presence. This, in turn, is part of
    a larger refusal to deal with Jewish issues in general, or to engage with
    the Jewish community as a real entity. Debates around left antisemitism have
    risen in tandem with the spread of anti-Zionism inside of the Left,
    especially since the Second Intifada. Anti-Zionism is not, by itself,
    antisemitism. One can call for the Right of Return, as well as dissolving
    Israel as a Jewish state, without being antisemitic. But there is a Venn
    diagram between anti- Zionism and antisemitism, and the overlap is both
    significant and has many shades of grey to it. One of the main reasons the
    Left can't acknowledge problems with antisemitism is that Jews persistently
    trouble categories, and the Left would have to rethink many
    things--including how it approaches antiimperialism, nationalism of the
    oppressed, anti-Zionism, identity politics, populism, conspiracy theories,
    and critiques of finance capital--if it was to truly struggle with the
    question. The Left understands that white supremacy isn't just the Ku Klux
    Klan and neo-Nazis, but that it is part of the fabric of society, and there
    is no shortcut to unstitching it. Antisemitism is also woven into social
    relationships--having been part of Western society since at least the Middle
    Ages. But the Left doesn't understand that. The problem is not just limited
    to the open and coded conspiracy theories about Jews and Jewish
    collectivities that circulate on the Left. It also can be seen in how the
    complex conflict in Israel/Palestine is compressed into a blackand- white
    portrayal, complete with the demonization of one party-- and mixed with
    out-of-hand dismissals of the Jewish community's complaints about
    antisemitism. Any acceptable approach must start with suppressing
    antisemitic conspiracy theories and refusing to uncritically back
    antisemitic groups--something that currently isn't happening. If the Left
    can't even get to first base, it is undoubtedly part of the rising tide of
    antisemitism we are seeing today. But dealing with this would mean far more
    than just taking these obvious actions, and the only way to work these
    issues out is to wrangle with them directly. The Left would do well to live
    up to its own values of opposing oppression by taking antisemitism in its
    own ranks seriously.

    Over the past two decades, the United States has seen a dramatic increase in
    the number and magnitude of punitive damages verdicts rendered by juries in
    civil trials. Probably the most extraordinary example is the July 2000 award
    of $144.8 billion in the Florida class action lawsuit brought against
    cigarette manufacturers. Or consider two recent verdicts against the auto
    manufacturer BMW in Alabama. In identical cases, argued in the same court
    before the same judge, one jury awarded $4 million in punitive damages,
    while the other awarded no punitive damages at all. In cases involving
    accidents, civil rights, and the environment, multimillion-dollar punitive
    awards have been a subject of intense controversy.  But how do juries
    actually make decisions about punitive damages? To find out, the
    authors-experts in psychology, economics, and the law-present the results of
    controlled experiments with more than 600 mock juries involving the
    responses of more than 8,000 jury-eligible citizens. Although juries tended
    to agree in their moral judgments about the defendant's conduct, they
    rendered erratic and unpredictable dollar awards. The experiments also
    showed that instead of moderating juror verdicts, the process of jury
    deliberation produced a striking "severity shift" toward ever-higher awards.
    Jurors also tended to ignore instructions from the judges; were influenced
    by whatever amount the plaintiff happened to request; showed "hindsight
    bias," believing that what happened should have been foreseen; and penalized
    corporations that had based their decisions on careful cost-benefit
    analyses. While judges made many of the same errors, they performed better
    in some areas, suggesting that judges (or other specialists) may be better
    equipped than juries to decide punitive damages.  Using a wealth of new
    experimental data, and offering a host of provocative findings, this book
    documents a wide range of systematic biases in jury behavior. It will be
    indispensable for anyone interested not only in punitive damages, but also
    jury behavior, psychology, and how people think about punishment.

    Abstract Stalin was a Marxist, but a certain kind of Marxist who selected
    out of the body of work of Marx, Engels, and Lenin a non-democratic and
    inhumane form of Marxism leaving out the humanist and democratic aspects of
    the original Marxist programme. The means he chose to build what he
    considered a socialist society fatally tainted the goal of a society in
    which working people make the fundamental decisions that determine their
    lives.

    Award-winning book showcases case studies uncovering the exploitation of
    labor and class in the Global SouthWinner of the 2018 Paul M. Sweezy—Paul A.
    Baran Memorial Award for original work regarding the political economy of
    imperialism, Value Chains examines the exploitation of labor in the Global
    South. Focusing on the issue of labor within global value chains, this book
    offers a deft empirical analysis of unit labor costs that is closely related
    to Marx’s own theory of exploitation.Value Chains uncovers the concrete
    processes through which multinational corporations, located primarily in the
    Global North, capture value from the Global South. We are brought face to
    face with various state-of-the-art corporate strategies that enforce
    “economical” and “flexible” production, including labor management methods,
    aimed to reassert the imperial dominance of the North, while continuing the
    dependency of the Global South and polarizing the global economy. Case
    studies of Indonesian suppliers exemplify the growing burden borne by the
    workers of the Global South, whose labor creates the surplus value that
    enriches the capitalists of the North, as well as the secondary capitals of
    the South. Today, those who control the value chains and siphon off the
    profits are primarily financial interests with vast economic and political
    power—the power that must be broken if the global working class is to
    liberate itself. Suwandi’s book depicts in concrete detail the relations of
    unequal exchange that structure today’s world economy. This study,
    up-to-date and richly documented, puts labor and class back at the center of
    our understanding of the world capitalist system.

    Culture has always been important for the kinds of processes students of
    social movements study. But as culture moves to the forefront of social
    movement research, it is important to address directly the theories,

    carry with them.  I begin by reviewing the basic theoretical approaches in
    the sociology of culture and go on to suggest that traditional Weberian
    approaches, which focus on powerful, internalized beliefs and values held by
    individual actors (what I call culture from the “inside out”) may ultimately

    This article demonstrates how the content and meaning of California’s
    consumer protection laws were shaped by automobile manufacturers, the very
    group these laws were designed to regulate. Specifically, the research
    question I examine is: How and under what conditions can business
    organizations shape the meaning of legislation, once it is enacted? I focus
    in particular on the capacity of private business to influence how and where
    disputes over public legal rights are resolved.  [B]usiness organizations
    across a wide variety of industries are increasingly engaged in “public”
    decisionmaking in private settings. Private entities are actively governing
    themselves while simultaneously delivering services

    This paper examines the ethical behaviour of new lawyers from two
    contrasting points of view. First, we review the prevalence and type of
    ethical misconduct by lawyers in the Australian state of Victoria during
    their first three years of practice. This examination is based upon data
    provided by the professional conduct oversight body, the Victorian Legal
    Services Board & Commissioner. An analysis of this data provides some
    understanding of how often and what kinds of misconduct occur, and how new
    lawyers differ from lawyers, however the data yields limited insight into
    how we might prevent ethical problems. Consequently, we turn to examine the
    findings from our empirical study into the ethical climate of legal
    workplaces. That study investigated the perceptions of new lawyers about the
    ethical climate of their workplaces and revealed that those perceptions
    influence new lawyers’ understandings of professionalism and ethical
    conduct, as well as their job and career satisfaction and psychological
    wellbeing. By interrogating the developmental and situational context in
    which ordinary ethicality develops or is inhibited, a new opportunity
    becomes available to shape new lawyers’ practice towards better ethical
    outcomes.

    The axe has finally fallen. In Janus v. American Federation of State,
    County, & Municipal Employees, Council 31, the Supreme Court struck down the
    major source of financial security enjoyed by public-sector unions, which
    represent nearly half of the nation’s fifteen million union members.
    Countless press stories, law review articles, and amicus briefs have
    criticized and defended this outcome. This Article has a different aim.
    Rather than relitigating Janus, the questions it asks are instead forward
    looking: What comes next? Is there life for public-sector unions after
    Janus? And if so, what might it look like? In engaging these questions, this
    Article has three goals. First, it pushes back on the narrative that public
    unions have no choice now but to struggle on within a national right-to-work
    environment. That is certainly one possibility, but pro-labor states have
    available a range of legislative responses that may soften Janus’s blow or
    even negate it altogether. One response that has generated vigorous debate
    in policy circles would be for pro-labor states to require public employers
    to reimburse unions for their bargaining-related costs directly. The
    standard objection is that this will undercut unions’ ability to advocate
    for workers. The Article’s second goal is to confront this objection
    head-on, with an argument that draws on an unlikely source: an analogy
    between public unions and public defenders. As it turns out, America’s
    woeful experience with indigent criminal defense teaches some powerful
    lessons about how not to fund entities whose purpose is to contest the
    government’s narrow self-interest. But it also suggests funding approaches
    that would raise no independence concerns at all. That leads to the
    Article’s final objective: to propose model legislation for state lawmakers
    to implement direct reimbursement of unions. The proposal is revenue neutral
    for public employers and unions, and it is wealth enhancing for workers in
    light of nuances in the federal income tax code. Readers interested in the
    nuts and bolts of the proposed legislation may wish to skip the first three
    parts of this Article, which make the case for why reimbursement is
    desirable, and start at Part IV. For convenience, a model bill is included
    in the Appendix.

    All social movements, to varying degrees, produce culture. Scholars who have
    studied the processes that make it possible for individuals and groups to
    come together to mount a concerted campaign for social change recognize that
    those who challenge the status quo face a formidable task. Most analysts
    agree that the mobilization of protest is facilitated by a group’s ability
    to develop and maintain a set of beliefs and loyalties that contradict those
    of dominant groups. Scholars have referred to the spheres of cultural
    autonomy necessary to the rise of social movements as “cultures of
    solidarity” (Fantasia 1988), “social movement communities”

  abstract: "By the late 1960s and early 1970s, reeling from a wave of urban uprisings, politicians finally worked to end the practice of redlining. Reasoning that the turbulence could be calmed by turning Black city-dwellers into homeowners, they passed the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, and set about establishing policies to induce mortgage lenders and the real estate industry to treat Black homebuyers equally. The disaster that ensued revealed that racist exclusion had not been eradicated, but rather transmuted into a new phenomenon of\_predatory inclusion.\_Race for Profit\_uncovers how exploitative real estate practices continued well after housing discrimination was banned. The same racist structures and individuals remained intact after redlining's end, and close relationships between regulators and the industry created incentives to ignore improprieties.\_Meanwhile, new policies meant to encourage low-income homeownership created new methods to exploit Black homeowners. The federal government guaranteed urban mortgages in an attempt to overcome resistance to lending to Black buyers – as if unprofitability, rather than racism, was the cause of housing segregation. Bankers, investors, and real estate agents took advantage of the perverse incentives, targeting the Black women most likely to fail to keep up their home payments and slip into foreclosure, multiplying their profits. As a result, by the end of the 1970s, the nation's first programs to encourage Black homeownership ended with tens of thousands of foreclosures in Black communities across the country. The push to uplift Black homeownership had descended into a goldmine for realtors and mortgage lenders, and a ready-made cudgel for the champions of deregulation to wield against government intervention of any kind.\_Narrating the story of a sea-change in housing policy and its dire impact on African Americans,\_Race for Profit\_reveals how the urban core was transformed into a new frontier of cynical extraction."

    After the 2008 global financial crisis, US law schools suffered a steep drop
    in enrollment. In response, many professional law programs, especially
    so-called fourth-tier institutions, turned to ethnoracial minorities as a
    new market for student recruitment. They relaxed admissions standards,
    enabling more “diverse” students to finance their studies with guaranteed
    federal student loans. By raising diversity in a lower-status “southern
    hemisphere” of legal education and services, however, this new approach
    replaced outright exclusion with a racialized professional dualism justified
    by the neoliberal ideology of market access. Some have called this an
    “apartheid model”—a freighted term with broad theoretical and ethical
    entanglements. This pairing of race and free-market logics resembles wider,
    specious extensions of market citizenship into the global peripheries. [law,

    Experts of capitalist labor and economy have called white-collar
    professionals a “re-embedded market” inasmuch as they defy expectations that
    free-market economic life should be liberated from social and moral
    constraints. In the USA, lawyers, a historically middle-class community,
    have re-embedded their profession through robust ethics rules that prohibit
    opportunistic behavior. But, in recent years, they have seen increased
    opportunism by legal academics toward aspiring students eager for a chance
    at professional upward mobility. This shift has manifested in the increased
    recruitment of working-class students into low-value law schools struggling
    to fill their seats after the global economic downturn. As legal education
    grew more accessible to the working class, it grew increasingly detached
    from the morally grounded economic judgment that once characterized
    professionalism. From this example, I argue that the embeddedness of
    professional labor may be tied to socioeconomic class relations more than
    advanced knowledge and the informational asymmetries that entails.

    The Myth of Capitalism tells the story of how America has gone from an open,
    competitive marketplace to an economy where a few very powerful companies
    dominate key industries that affect our daily lives. Digital monopolies like
    Google, Facebook and Amazon act as gatekeepers to the digital world. Amazon
    is capturing almost all online shopping dollars. We have the illusion of
    choice, but for most critical decisions, we have only one or two companies,
    when it comes to high speed Internet, health insurance, medical care,
    mortgage title insurance, social networks, Internet searches, or even
    consumer goods like toothpaste. Every day, the average American transfers a
    little of their pay check to monopolists and oligopolists. The solution is
    vigorous anti-trust enforcement to return America to a period where
    competition created higher economic growth, more jobs, higher wages and a
    level playing field for all. The Myth of Capitalism is the story of
    industrial concentration, but it matters to everyone, because the stakes
    could not be higher. It tackles the big questions of: why is the US becoming
    a more unequal society, why is economic growth anemic despite trillions of
    dollars of federal debt and money printing, why the number of start-ups has
    declined, and why are workers losing out.

    Brian Schrauger, in The Jerusalem Post, discussed Jews being "slaughtered,"
    "murdered," "bludgeoned to death, herded into houses to be burned alive en
    masse, stripped naked and marched to a collective massacre," before asking
    "Could COVID-19 ignite an outbreak of antisemitism?"6 Dan Freedman, in
    Moment Magazine, sought to explain "why Jews were blamed for the Black
    Death"; doing so, he too repeated the language of persecution by
    highlighting "episodes of violence," "slaughter," "burning," "torture," and
    more.7 Although Freedman did not answer the question asked, the answer seems
    implicit in the vocabulary he employed. [...]it may do the opposite; it may
    encourage hatred and violence as evidenced by the fact that some of the
    perpetrators of anti-Jewish attacks today have been known to have Googled
    questions like, for example, "Why Did Hitler Hate Jews?"10 The current
    popular writing about American Jews in the era of the pandemic (and Trump)
    feels eerily like Leidensgeschichte (the history of suffering), but without
    the Gelehrtengeschichte (the history of learning) that was equally a
    hallmark of much nineteenth-century Jewish historiography. In his piece,
    Roth challenged the idea that all violence from which Jews suffered was
    automatically antisemitic.17 Episodes of "Jewish martyrdom," Roth argued,
    were very often episodes of "general history," with Jews caught in bigger
    events.18 A few years later, Roth published his popular A Short History of
    the Jewish People, in which he declared his desire "to break with" earlier
    Jewish historiography that tended to overstress "the traditional tale of
    woe. [...]both authors explicitly or implicitly used their scholarship to
    combat antisemitism, in part by expanding the existing understanding of what
    Jewish life and experience had been like in the past.21 Both Baron and Roth,
    in different ways, strove

  abstract: "The intricate practices of the elite and how they maintain their dominance.In his new book, Göran Therborn – author of the now standard comparative work on classical sociology and historical materialism,\_Science, Class and Society\_– looks at successive state structures in an arrestingly fresh perspective. Therborn uses the formal categories of modern system analysis – input mechanisms, processes of transformation, output flows – to advance a substantive Marxist analysis of state power and state apparatuses. His account of these is comparative in the most far-reaching historical sense: its object is nothing less than the construction of systematic typology of the differences between the feudal state, the capitalist state and the socialist state. Therborn ranges from the monarchies of mediaeval Europe through the bourgeois democracies of the west in the 20th\_century to the contemporary regimes in Russia, Eastern Europe and China. The book ends with a major analytic survey of the strategies of working class parties for socialism, from the Second International to the Comintern to Eurocommunism, that applies the structural findings of Therborn’s enquiry in the ‘Future as History’. Written with lucidity and economy,\_What Does the Ruling Class Do when it Rules?\_represents a remarkable sociological and political synthesis."

    Working on the Dock of the Bay explores the history of waterfront labor and
    laborers―black and white, enslaved and free, native and immigrant―in
    Charleston, South Carolina, between the American Revolution and Civil War.
    Michael D. Thompson explains how a predominantly enslaved workforce laid the
    groundwork for the creation of a robust and effectual association of
    dockworkers, most of whom were black, shortly after emancipation. In
    revealing these wharf laborers' experiences, Thompson's book contextualizes
    the struggles of contemporary southern working people.Like their postbellum
    and present-day counterparts, stevedores and draymen laboring on the wharves
    and levees of antebellum cities―whether in Charleston or New Orleans, New
    York or Boston, or elsewhere in the Atlantic World―were indispensable to the
    flow of commodities into and out of these ports. Despite their large numbers
    and the key role that waterfront workers played in these cities'
    premechanized, labor-intensive commercial economies, too little is known
    about who these laborers were and the work they performed. Though scholars
    have explored the history of dockworkers in ports throughout the world, they
    have given little attention to waterfront laborers and dock work in the
    pre-Civil War American South or in any slave society. Aiming to remedy that
    deficiency, Thompson examines the complicated dynamics of race, class, and
    labor relations through the street-level experiences and perspectives of
    workingmen and sometimes workingwomen. Using this workers'-eye view of
    crucial events and developments, Working on the Dock of the Bay relocates
    waterfront workers and their activities from the margins of the past to the
    center of a new narrative, reframing their role from observers to critical
    actors in nineteenth-century American history. Organized topically, this
    study is rooted in primary source evidence including census, tax, court, and
    death records; city directories and ordinances; state statutes; wills;
    account books; newspapers; diaries; letters; and medical journals.

    In this pathbreaking work, now available in paperback, Charles Tilly
    challenges all previous formulations of state development in Europe.
    Specifically, Tilly charges that most available explanations fail because
    they do not account for the great variety of kinds of states which were
    viable at different stages of European history, and because they assume a
    unilinear path of state development resolving in today's national state.

    Social Movements 1768-2018 provides the most comprehensive historical
    account of the birth and spread of social movements. Renowned social
    scientist Charles Tilly applies his synthetic theoretical skills to explain
    the evolution of social movements across time and space in an accessible
    manner full of historical vignettes and examples. Tilly explains why social
    movements are but a type of contentious politics to decrease categorical
    inequalities. Questions addressed include what are the implications of
    globalization and new technologies for social movements, and what are the
    prospects for social movements? The overall argument includes data from
    mobilizations in England, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Russia, China, India,
    Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Egypt, Tunisia, Iran, Iraq, and Kazakhstan. 
    This new edition has been fully updated and revised with young researchers
    and students in mind. New case studies focus on social movements in Mexico,
    Spain, and the United States including Black Lives Matter, immigrants’
    rights struggles, The Indignados, the Catalan movement for independence,
    #YoSoy132, Ayotzinapa43, mass incarceration and prisoner rights, and more.
    Timelines are included to familiarise the reader with the events discussed
    and discussion questions are framed to increase understanding of the
    implications, limits, and importance of historical and ongoing social
    movements.

    The US workplace is a private dictatorship where bosses exercise
    extraordinary power and systematically union bust. “Salting,” or getting a
    job with the intent to organize a workplace, is a completely justifiable
    response to this workplace despotism.

  abstract: >-
    The Jews and Germany debunks a modern myth: that once upon a time there was
    a Judeo-German symbiosis, in which two cultures met and brought out the best
    in each other. Enzo Traverso argues that to the contrary, the attainments of
    Jews in the German-speaking world were due to the Jews aspiring to be
    German, with little help from and often against the open hostility of
    Germans. As the Holocaust proved in murder and theft, German Jews could
    never be German enough. Now the works of German Jews are being published and
    reprinted in Germany. It is a matter of enormous difference whether the
    German rediscovery of German Jews is another annexation of Jewish property
    or an act of rebuilding a link between traditions. Traverso shows how
    tenuous the link was in the first place. He resumes the queries of German
    Jews who asked throughout the twentieth century what it meant to be both
    Jewish and German. Hannah Arendt, Gershom Scholem, Martin Buber, Max
    Horkheimer, Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno, Ernst Bloch, Rosa Luxemburg,
    Franz Kafka, and many more thinkers of genius found the problems unavoidable
    and full of paradoxes. In returning to them Traverso not only demolishes a
    sugary myth but also reasserts the responsibility of history to recover
    memory, even if bitter and full of pain. Enzo Traverso was born in Italy in
    1957. He currently works at the Bibliothéque de documentation internationale
    contemporaine in Nanterre, where he is in charge of the German section of
    documentary research. He is also the author of The Marxists and the Jewish
    Question: History of a Debate, 1843-1943.

  abstract: >-
    This article investigates why cause lawyering organizations choose policy
    work and how policy agendas are set. Interviews and documents from eight
    legal organizations in the LGBTQ movement reveal that policy work expands
    the scope of conflict, giving organizations not only more opportunities to
    act, but potentially providing greater autonomy to lawyers by allowing them
    to build their own opportunities. Furthermore, policy agendas are not simply
    tied to litigation and resources. Organizations balance perceptions of
    opportunity and need with resource availability. These perceptions are often
    informed by collaborations with state and local organizations, facilitating
    communication between groups, organizers, and activists at different vantage
    points. Thus, the nature of a legal organization's multidimensional
    strategy, which expands opportunities to reach their goals, may be shaping
    what those goals are. These findings contribute to our understanding of
    cause lawyering tactics and agendas.

  abstract: >-
    Here a leading scholar in constitutional law, Mark Tushnet, challenges
    hallowed American traditions of judicial review and judicial supremacy,
    which allow U.S. judges to invalidate "unconstitutional" governmental
    actions. Many people, particularly liberals, have "warm and fuzzy" feelings
    about judicial review. They are nervous about what might happen to
    unprotected constitutional provisions in the chaotic worlds of practical
    politics and everyday life. By examining a wide range of situations
    involving constitutional rights, Tushnet vigorously encourages us all to
    take responsibility for protecting our liberties. Guarding them is not the
    preserve of judges, he maintains, but a commitment of the citizenry to
    define itself as "We the People of the United States." The Constitution
    belongs to us collectively, as we act in political dialogue with each
    other--whether in the street, in the voting booth, or in the legislature as
    representatives of others. Tushnet urges that we create a "populist"
    constitutional law in which judicial declarations deserve no special
    consideration. But he warns that in so doing we must pursue reasonable
    interpretations of the "thin Constitution"--the fundamental American
    principles embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Preamble to
    the Constitution. A populist Constitution, he maintains, will be more
    effective than a document exclusively protected by the courts. Tushnet
    believes, for example, that the serious problems of the communist scare of
    the 1950s were aggravated when Senator Joseph McCarthy's opponents were
    lulled into inaction, believing that the judicial branch would step in and
    declare McCarthy's actions unconstitutional. Instead of fulfilling the
    expectations, the Court allowed McCarthy to continue his crusade until it
    was ended. Tushnet points out that in this context and in many others,
    errors occurred because of the existence of judicial review: neither the
    People nor their representatives felt empowered to enforce the Constitution
    because they mistakenly counted on the courts to do so. Tushnet's clarion
    call for a new kind of constitutional law will be essential reading for
    constitutional law experts, political scientists, and others interested in
    how and if the freedoms of the American Republic can survive into the
    twenty-first century.

    The desire to punish those who break social rules is a widespread, if not
    universal, feature of human societies. Social psychologists, sociologists,
    and other law and society scholars have a long-standing interest in
    understanding why people want to punish rule breakers, that is, in
    understanding the social meaning of rule-breaking behavior.  This study
    explores why people want to punish rule breakers. It addresses two issues:
    (1) the sources of support for the punishment of rule-breaking behavior and
    (2) the nature of public support for punishing those who break social rules.
    Three basic sources of support are compared: crime-related concerns,
    concerns

    This paper describes the ways in which African Americans were written out of
    or subordinated within the social policies of the New Deal period. To
    explain this feature of the New Deal, I argue that the existing social
    science perspectives on social policy need to be built on a greater
    appreciation of the role of racial subjugation in the construction of class
    interests, party processes, and the state. The recovery of this racial basis
    helps us understand why our liberal welfare state resists efforts to move in
    a more social democratic direction.

    This paper describes the informal system of property rights that
    characterizes the commercially valuable lobster fishery pursued in St.
    George's Bay, northeastern Nova Scotia, by the descendents of Scottish
    Gaels. In this setting, discrete family-defined but individually "owned"
    lobster fishing berths coexist cheek by jowl with a "common ground" fishery.
    The principles governing the berth system derive, in part, from a land-based
    system of usufruct rights termed "kindnesses" in 18th century Scotland. The
    historical, familial, and community attributes of the berth system are
    outlined, as are the characteristics of the coexistent common ground
    fishery. Lobster harvesters with berth rights and many without argue that
    the berth system, in and of itself, is an effective conservation mechanism.
    This contention is described and discussed in relation to historical
    evidence respecting local lobster landings and recruitment characteristics.
    The paper concludes by arguing, first of all, that regulatory authorities
    should pay far more attention to the role played by informal property rights
    systems in accomplishing the goals of conservation and good management.
    While fisheries of this type are typically described in the literature as
    common property systems, we argue that they are, in fact, mixed property
    systems—a fact not adequately accounted for by existing regulatory policy or
    common property theory.

  abstract: >-
    This article examines how the legal-institutional context created by
    American labor law has impacted the frequency, issue composition, and
    economic damage of strike activity since the passage of the Taft-Hartley
    Act. Emphasis on the legal-institutional context complements conventional
    perspectives of strike activity which focus on business cycle and
    political-organizational interpretations. A new labor law index is developed
    to measure the legal-institutional context, and it is comprised of five
    components: number of pro-labor laws, National Labor Relations Board unfair
    labor cases filed, use of antilabor injunctions, labor mediation, and labor
    arbitration. For the period of 1948 to 1980, high values on the labor law
    index reduced overall strike frequency, reduced some types of
    control-related strikes, had no effect on economic strikes, and decreased
    working time lost to strikes, especially in the monopoly sector. These
    findings suggest that the legal- institutional context of the post-Taft-
    Hartley period has served to regulate and delegitimize expressions of labor
    unrest that most seriously challenge capitalist interests.

    In History of the Jews in the Bohemian Lands, Martin Wein traces the
    interaction of Czechs and Jews, but also of Christian German-speakers,
    Slovaks, and other groups in the Bohemian lands and in Czechoslovakia
    throughout the first half of the twentieth century. This period saw
    accelerated nation-building and nation-cleansing in the context of hegemony
    exercised by a changing cast of great powers, namely Austria-Hungary,
    France, Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union. The author examines
    Christian-Jewish and inner-Jewish relations in various periods and
    provinces, including in Subcarpathian Ruthenia, emphasizing interreligious
    alliances of Jews with Protestants, such as T. G. Masaryk, and political
    parties, for example a number of Social Democratic ones. The writings of
    Prague’s Czech-German-Jewish founders of theories of nationalism, Hans Kohn,
    Karl W. Deutsch, and Ernest Gellner, help to interpret this history.

    In contrast to the diverse trends that prevailed for most of the postwar
    period, unionization rates in the advanced capitalist countries generally
    declined in the 1980s. I propose a discrete-time hazard-rate model to
    explain this novel pattern of labor disorganization. Model estimates
    indicate that union decline is related to growing economic openness,
    unemployment, pre-existing levels of unionization, the decentralization of
    collective bargaining institutions, and the electoral failure of social
    democratic parties through the 1980s.

    The current review presents both postulated and empirically tested
    consequences of university unionization and labor strikes on the North
    American institution's administration, faculty, and students. The review
    explores the impact of collective bargining on employee working conditions
    including job security, academic freedom, university governance, and due
    process. More importantly, this review examines the much neglected issue of
    organizational work relationships in a unionized academic environment. The
    relationships discussed include those between faculty members, between the
    faculty and administration, betweenthe faculty and the university as an
    institution, and between the faculty and their union. The threat of
    unionization and labor strikes to the profess rstudent or mentor-mentee
    relationship has been a central concern of those opposed to graduate student
    unions, and this issue is also addressed here. The text concludes with he
    identification of potential areas for future research.

    In 1914, Joe Hill, the prolific songwriter for the Industrial Workers of the
    World (also known as the Wobblies), was convicted of murder in Utah and
    sentenced to death by firing squad, igniting international controversy. In
    the first major biography of the radical historical icon, William M. Adler
    explores an extraordinary life and presents persuasive evidence of Hill's
    innocence. Hill would become organized labor's most venerated martyr, and a
    hero to folk singers such as Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan. His story shines a
    beacon on the early-twentieth-century American experience and exposes the
    roots of issues critical to the twenty-first century.

  abstract: >-
    Almost since its creation at the close of the nineteenth century, the
    Teamsters Union has had recurring problems with corruption. This book is the
    first in-depth historical study of the forces that have contributed to the
    Teamsters' troubled past, as well as the various mechanisms the union has
    employed--from top-down directives to grass-roots measures--to combat the
    spread of corruption. Arguing that the Teamsters Union was by its very
    nature especially vulnerable to certain forms of corruption, David Witwer
    charts the process by which organized crime came to play a significant role
    in sectors of the union, from low-level involvements of the 1930s to
    suspicions of mob ties among the union's upper echelons beginning in the
    1950s. Witwer includes a detailed account of the links forged between the
    mafia and union head Jimmy Hoffa as well as the highly revealing McLellan
    Committee investigation that first brought these links to light. David
    Witwer is a former employee of the New York County District Attorney's
    Office and the U.S. Attorney's Office. Drawing on hundreds of hours of tapes
    of activities and conversations in the offices of corrupt union officials,
    he brings his experience and insight to bear on the union's history,
    considering the subject from a range of perspectives that include the rank
    and file, the Teamster leadership, and the criminal element. He also
    examines the persistent efforts of labor opponents to capitalize on the
    union's unsavory reputation, fanning the flames of "crises of corruption" in
    order to influence popular and legislative opinion.

    Capitalism is not a natural and inevitable consequence of human nature, nor
    is it simply an extension of age-old practices of trade and commerce.In this
    original and provocative book Ellen Meiksins Wood reminds us that capitalism
    is not a natural and inevitable consequence of human nature, nor is it
    simply an extension of age-old practices of trade and commerce. Rather, it
    is a late and localized product of very specific historical conditions,
    which required great transformations in social relations and in the human
    interaction with nature.This new edition is substantially revised and
    expanded, with extensive new material on imperialism, anti-Eurocentric
    history, capitalism and the nation-state, and the differences between
    capitalism and non-capitalist commerce. The author traces links between the
    origin of capitalism and contemporary conditions such as ‘globalization’,
    ecological degradation, and the current agricultural crisis.

    Historian and political thinker Ellen Meiksins Wood argues that theories of
    “postmodern” fragmentation, “difference,” and con-tingency can barely
    accommodate the idea of capitalism, let alone subject it to critique. In
    this book she sets out to renew the critical program of historical
    materialism by redefining its basic concepts and its theory of history in
    original and imaginative ways, using them to identify the specificity of
    capitalism as a system of social relations and political power. She goes on
    to explore the concept of democracy in both the ancient and modern world,
    examining its relation to capitalism, and raising questions about how
    democracy might go beyond the limits imposed on it.

    One of the major works of the new American Marxism, Wright’s book draws a
    challenging new class map of the United States and other, comparable,
    advanced capitalist countries today. It also discusses the various classical
    theories of economic crisis in the West and their relevance to the current
    recession, and contrasts the way in which the major political problem of
    bureaucracy was confronted by two great antagonists—Weber and Lenin. A
    concluding essay brings together the practical lessons of these theoretical
    analyses, in an examination of the problems of left governments coming to
    power in capitalist states.

    "Persuasive and brilliantly written, the book is especially timely given the
    rise of trillion-dollar tech companies."--Publishers WeeklyFrom the man who
    coined the term "net neutrality," author of The Master Switch and The
    Attention Merchants, comes a warning about the dangers of excessive
    corporate and industrial concentration for our economic and political
    future.We live in an age of extreme corporate concentration, in which global
    industries are controlled by just a few giant firms -- big banks, big
    pharma, and big tech, just to name a few. But concern over what Louis
    Brandeis called the "curse of bigness" can no longer remain the province of
    specialist lawyers and economists, for it has spilled over into policy and
    politics, even threatening democracy itself. History suggests that tolerance
    of inequality and failing to control excessive corporate power may prompt
    the rise of populism, nationalism, extremist politicians, and fascist
    regimes. In short, as Wu warns, we are in grave danger of repeating the
    signature errors of the twentieth century.In The Curse of Bigness, Columbia
    professor Tim Wu tells of how figures like Brandeis and Theodore Roosevelt
    first confronted the democratic threats posed by the great trusts of the
    Gilded Age--but the lessons of the Progressive Era were forgotten in the
    last 40 years. He calls for recovering the lost tenets of the trustbusting
    age as part of a broader revival of American progressive ideas as we
    confront the fallout of persistent and extreme economic inequality.

    In a series of autobiographical essays written on the border between fiction
    and non-fiction, a radical economist considers what it means to live in and
    through the theories about class that have informed his work and teaching.
    Yates seeks to bring the complexity and ambiguity of class, racial, and
    gender identity into focus through his own life. Yates writes of the erosion
    of self-confidence and the anxiety caused by the everyday fears of
    working-class families. He speaks honestly of the ambivalence and heartbreak
    caused by upward economic mobility, while relating in a deeply personal way
    to the structures of class inequality in American life.

    A growing inequality in income and wealth marks modern capitalism, and it
    negatively affects nearly every aspect of our lives, especially those of the
    working class. It is and will continue to be the central issue of politics
    in almost every nation on earth. In this book, the author explains
    inequality in clear, passionate, and intelligent prose: what it is, why it
    matters, how it affects us, what its underlying causes are, and what we
    might do about it. This book was written to encourage informed radical
    action by working people, the unemployed, and the poor, uniquely blending
    the author’s own experiences with his ability to make complex issues
    comprehensible to a mass audience. This book will be excellent for courses
    in a variety of disciplines, and it will be useful to activists and the
    general reading public.

  title: The Great Inequality
  type: book

- id: yatesCanWorkingClass2018
  abstract: >-
    One of the horrors of the capitalist system is that slave labor, which was
    central to the formation and growth of capitalism itself, is still fully
    able to coexist alongside wage labor. But, as Karl Marx points out, it is
    the fact of being paid for one's work that validates capitalism as a viable
    socio-economic structure. Beneath this veil of “free commerce” – where
    workers are paid only for a portion of their workday, and buyers and sellers
    in the marketplace face each other as “equals” – lies a foundation of
    immense inequality. Yet workers have always rebelled. They've organized
    unions, struck, picketed, boycotted, formed political organizations and
    parties – sometimes they have actually won and improved their lives. But,
    Marx argued, because capitalism is the apotheosis of class society, it must
    be the last class society: it must, therefore, be destroyed. And only the
    working class, said Marx, is capable of creating that change.In his timely
    and innovative book, Michael D. Yates asks if the working class can, indeed,
    change the world. Deftly factoring in such contemporary elements as sharp
    changes in the rise of identity politics and the nature of work, itself,
    Yates asks if there can, in fact, be a thing called the working class? If
    so, how might it overcome inherent divisions of gender, race, ethnicity,
    religion, location – to become a cohesive and radical force for change?
    Forcefully and without illusions, Yates supports his arguments with
    relevant, clearly explained data, historical examples, and his own personal
    experiences. This book is a sophisticated and prescient understanding of the
    working class, and what all of us might do to change the world.

  abstract: >-
    In this new edition of Why Unions Matter, Michael D. Yates shows why unions
    still matter. Unions mean better pay, benefits, and working conditions for
    their members; they force employers to treat employees with dignity and
    respect; and at their best, they provide a way for workers to make society
    both more democratic and egalitarian. Yates uses simple language, clear
    data, and engaging examples to show why workers need unions, how unions are
    formed, how they operate, how collective bargaining works, the role of
    unions in politics, and what unions have done to bring workers together
    across the divides of race, gender, religion, and sexual orientation. The
    new edition not onlyupdates the first, but also examines the record of the
    New Voice slate that took control of the AFL-CIO in 1995, the continuing
    decline in union membership and density, the Change to Win split in 2005,
    the growing importance of immigrant workers, the rise of worker centers, the
    impacts of and labor responses to globalization, and the need for labor to
    have an independent political voice. This is simply the best introduction to
    unions on the market.

  abstract: >-
    In early 2011, the nation was stunned to watch Wisconsin’s state capitol in
    Madison come under sudden and unexpected occupation by union members and
    their allies. The protests to defend collective bargaining rights were
    militant and practically unheard of in this era of declining union power.
    Nearly forty years of neoliberalism and the most severe economic crisis
    since the Great Depression have battered the labor movement, and workers
    have been largely complacent in the face of stagnant wages, slashed benefits
    and services, widening unemployment, and growing inequality. That is, until
    now. Under pressure from a union-busting governor and his supporters in the
    legislature, and inspired by the massive uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt,
    workers in Wisconsin shook the nation with their colossal display of
    solidarity and outrage. Their struggle is still ongoing, but there are
    lessons to be learned from the Wisconsin revolt. This timely book brings
    together some of the best labor journalists and scholars in the United
    States, many of whom were on the ground at the time, to examine the causes
    and impact of events, and suggest how the labor movement might proceed in
    this new era of union militancy.

    Some describe civil litigation as little more than a drag on the economy;
    Others hail it as the solution to most of the country’s problems. Stephen C.
    Yeazell argues that both positions are wrong. Deeply embedded in our
    political and economic systems, civil litigation is both a system for
    resolving disputes and a successful business model, a fact that both its
    opponents and its fans do their best to conceal.Lawsuits in a Market Economy
    explains how contemporary civil litigation in the United States works and
    how it has changed over the past century. The book corrects common
    misconceptions—some of which have proved remarkably durable even in the face
    of contrary evidence—and explores how our constitutional structure, an
    evolving economy, and developments in procedural rules and litigation
    financing systems have moved us from expecting that lawsuits end in trial
    and judgments to expecting that they will end in settlements. Yeazell argues
    that today’s system has in some ways overcome—albeit
    inconsistently—disparities between the rich and poor in access to civil
    justice. Once upon a time, might regularly triumphed over right. That is
    slightly less likely today—even though we continue to witness enormous
    disparities in wealth and power. The book concludes with an evaluation of
    recent changes and their possible consequences.

    In recent years, prominent constitutional law scholars have made arguments
    for greater popular participation in determinations about the U.S.
    Constitution’s meaning. Kramer and Tushnet have offered two of the most
    prominent arguments for restricting the court’s role in determining the
    meaning of the Constitution. Kramer emphasizes popular conclusions about the
    Constitution, while Tushnet stresses congressional deliberation. Yet these
    authors share the central conviction that courts’ active involvement in
    constitutional politics discourages and distorts the participation of
    nonjudicial actors (Tushnet 1999; Kramer 2004). The main thrust of both
    arguments is that American politics would be more democratic, and therefore

    Recent years have seen a major reassessment of the forced migration of the
    1930s and 1940s to the United States with regard to the history of the
    sciences and humanities. Mitchell G. Ash aptly phrased this reappraisal a
    scientific innovation through forced migration. This was not a new concept.
    The social scientist Paul Lazarsfeld, himself an émigré from Austria in the
    1930s and a major figure in the innovation of the social sciences, stated as
    an autobiographical and, as it were, autosociological observation that
    innovation can often be traced back to individuals who belong to two worlds

    The challenges to humanity posed by the digital future, the first detailed
    examination of the unprecedented form of power called "surveillance
    capitalism," and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control
    our behavior.In this masterwork of original thinking and research, Shoshana
    Zuboff provides startling insights into the phenomenon that she has named
    surveillance capitalism. The stakes could not be higher: a global
    architecture of behavior modification threatens human nature in the
    twenty-first century just as industrial capitalism disfigured the natural
    world in the twentieth.Zuboff vividly brings to life the consequences as
    surveillance capitalism advances from Silicon Valley into every economic
    sector. Vast wealth and power are accumulated in ominous new "behavioral
    futures markets," where predictions about our behavior are bought and sold,
    and the production of goods and services is subordinated to a new "means of
    behavioral modification."The threat has shifted from a totalitarian Big
    Brother state to a ubiquitous digital architecture: a "Big Other" operating
    in the interests of surveillance capital. Here is the crucible of an
    unprecedented form of power marked by extreme concentrations of knowledge
    and free from democratic oversight. Zuboff's comprehensive and moving
    analysis lays bare the threats to twenty-first century society: a controlled
    "hive" of total connection that seduces with promises of total certainty for
    maximum profit--at the expense of democracy, freedom, and our human
    future.With little resistance from law or society, surveillance capitalism
    is on the verge of dominating the social order and shaping the digital
    future--if we let it.
